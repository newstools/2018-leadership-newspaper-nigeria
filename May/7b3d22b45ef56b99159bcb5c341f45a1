For the second time, a libel suit filed by former governor of Borno State, Ali Modu Sheriff against Borno State’s Attorney General and Commissioner of Justice, Barrister Kaka Shehu Lawan alongside two newspapers, The Punch and Daily Trust, has suffered defeat as an FCT High Court sitting in Jabi, Abuja struck out application by Sheriff to re-file his case to the same court that dismissed it in April, 2018. Lawan had in 2016 attended a legal conference in Port Harcourt during which he made presentation with respect to genesis of the Boko Haram insurgency, alleging that as then governor of Borno State, certain actions of Ali Modu Sheriff played a key role in giving birth to the crisis. Following media reports on Lawan’s presentation, Sheriff challenged the lawyer to publish evidence in support of his claims. Lawan then made publications in two newspapers, Daily Trust and Punch, listing “40 facts” with dated chronicles of the Boko Haram crisis which point to how alleged mishandling of events by Sheriff as governor of Borno State between 2003 and 2011 gave birth to ongoing violence perpetrated by Boko Haram insurgents resulting in endless killings. Sheriff went to court seeking N10 billion as damages.
