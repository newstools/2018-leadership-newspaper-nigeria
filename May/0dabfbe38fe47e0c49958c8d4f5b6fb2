As the momentum gathers towards the 2019 presidential election for which incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari has declared his ambition for a second term, some stakeholders in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) are said to be mulling the idea of making the governor of Gombe State, Ibrahim Hassan Dankwambo, the presidential candidate of the party. An impeccable source said the search for a credible candidate that will match President Muhammadu Buhari at the polls has culminated in the meeting of different groups from which the consensus appears to be Gombe State governor, Dankwanbo. Although Dankwambo is yet to formally declare his intention to run, it was gathered that his choice was informed by what a governor from the South- South geo-political zone described as a desperate need for the PDP to put forward “its best foot.” According to the governor, PDP faces a crisis of credibility arising from its poor performance in power and “we need a candidate who is not only competent but has the appeal to erase our poor perception from the mind of Nigerians with his impeccable credentials.” The choice of Dankwambo is said to be supported by many serving and former PDP governors, ministers and other bigwigs who see in him the combination of competence and capacity. Dankwanbo was the nation’s Accountant-General before he contested and won the Gombe State governorship election in 2011. He is reputed to have turned the fortunes of his state around for the better, with little resources. He is also noted for his transparency and honesty.
