Turaki, the former Minister of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs. It is no longer news that he is contesting the 2019 Presidential Election, especially with his posters spreading in all the nook and crannies across the country. We thank him for responding to the clarion call from Nigerians and the youths in this country will massively support him. “He has showcased himself in previous appointments held at the national levels and we believe in his ability to revamp our economy, resuscitate our ailing security apparatus, unite our people and totally rekindle the trust of Nigerians on the affairs of government in Nigeria,” Abdullahi declared. The statement further pointed out the abysmal performance of led All Progressives Congress (APC) administration, saying that the government has not lived up to expectation after making series of promises to Nigerians before the 2015 general elections.
