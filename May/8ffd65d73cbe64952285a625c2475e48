The resident engineer maintained that the minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, would be signing an agreement in China, this week, for the manufacturing of 12 sets of trains, comprising four coaches each, with 1000 personsâ€™ capacity, adding that the trains would be manufactured to specification, in line with precise measurements of the entire Abuja rail system. Agbakoba described the Abuja rail as one of the safest in the world, adding that it is separated from other road users and constructed without rail-crossing, thereby foreclosing any possible of cars or humans having to cross it at any points.
