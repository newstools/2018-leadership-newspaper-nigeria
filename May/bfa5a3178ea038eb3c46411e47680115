By Barr Aisha Wakil, a human rights activist, has revealed that many members of the boko haram terrorist sect are tired of carrying arms and are willing to surrender and embrace.Wakili also said that she would not rest until all the abducted schoolgirls, including the remaining Chibok Schoolgirls, as well as the only Dapchi Schoolgirl, are released. She assured of her readiness in the negotiation for the freedom of all the girls and women in boko haram captivity. The activist, who is popularly known as Mama Boko Haram, because of her roles at various times between the terrorists and the Nigeria government on negotiation for the release of boko haram abductees, made the disclosure to newsmen yesterday in Maiduguri, during the commissioning of the multi-million Naira ultra-modern field office of her non-governmental organisation (NGO), Complete Care and Aid Foundation; and the fund raising for N500 million northeast humanitarian intervention. She said the insurgents are still in arm struggle against Nigeria because they do not yet trust the amnesty plan of the federal government.
Wakil, who is believed to be part of the negotiation of many of the abducted Chibok girls and recently the Dapchi schoolgirls, said she does not feel bad being called Mama Boko Haram as the name only shows that she is one of the few that the insurgency group listen to.
She said, “I am not called Mama Boko Haram because I sponsored insurgency but rather because the group listens to me and respect me.
“So, I do not feel ashamed with the name because I am only playing a role that will ensure that the society does not completely degenerate.”
She said she decided to take a step further by establishing an NGO to make the society heal from its illnesses and get back on track.
Continuing she said, “So far, with the little funds generated from messengers of peace and other well wishers (names withheld), we distributed food items to more than 500,000 displaced persons, and we also assisted women with medical needs, education is also not left behind.
