The National Orientation Agency (NOA) has warned Nigeria to desist from hate speech saying, such speech is capable of depriving the nation of national cohesion, unity and progress. The director, NOA, Mr David Manya who said this during a programme organised by the Awareness For Good Leadership Peace And Development, entitled: ‘‘Campaign Against Hate Speech and Violence’’ in Abuja, said such comment can also deprive the youth and the unborn generation of having a peaceful country. Manya urged Nigerians to dialogue and not engage in hateful and dangerous speeches that can lead to war. According to him, “Even God himself is love and it is only love that can make us achieve desired growth as a nation and not hate speeches culpable of leading to hate action. ‘’What we are doing in Nigeria is capable of depriving us, most especially the youth and the unborn generation, of having a peaceful country. “No matter who you are, we can all come to the dialogue table to discuss how to find an area of interest. “Let us not experience war again forced by hate speech, let us not try to experience it because Nigeria may not find it easy,” he said. Manya, who was represented by Chinwe Ikaraoha, said the mandate of NOA is to enlighten the people about hate speech. ‘’We have gone ahead to organise programmes to educate the youths, the importance of the project which is running an ongoing programme since last year, is on promoting peace. ‘’We invited the traditional rulers, some religious leaders, we have some for the youth and also we have also had the programmes for bloggers, because some of those things they send out on social media is because they are looking for traffic, all these are causing so much to the national development,” she added.
