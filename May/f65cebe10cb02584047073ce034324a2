Leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in Ekiti State has picked immediate past Chairman of Ado Local Government, Kazeem Deji Ogunsakin, as the running mate to its Governorship candidate, Prof. Kolapo Olusola Eleka. The decision was reached on Friday, after extensive consultations with various stakeholders, including the youths and religious groups in the state. The choice of 39 year old Economist and Banker was informed by the need to involve the younger generation in governance of the State in line with the global teens as well as give the Muslim community in the State a sense of belonging. It was learnt that his choice was informed by the fact that Ado Ekiti, being the state capital with the largest voting population, deserves consideration for the deputy governorship position. The PDP Deputy Governorship candidate, a graduate of Economics from the Ekiti State University, Ado Ekiti, also holds a Mastersâ€™ degree in Business Administration from the University of Lagos. Until his nomination, he was the head of the Due Process Office.
