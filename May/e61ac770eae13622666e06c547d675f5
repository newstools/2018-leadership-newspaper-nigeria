The House of Representatives yesterday revealed that it had resolved to pass the 2018 Appropriation Bill on Tuesday. The chairman of the House Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Rep. Abdulrazak Namdas, who disclosed this to journalists in Abuja, expressed regret at the inability of the National Assembly to pass the budget on time. Namdas said, “We have not been able to pass the budget last week, but by the grace of God, we will lay it next Tuesday and pass it hopefully same day.” The House spokesman further stated that the House would observe three days of mourning in honour of victims of herdsmen attacks in Benue and other states of the federation after the passage of the budget. He stressed that the House was concerned at the spate of killings across the country. According to him, the three-day suspension of plenary would be done in a manner that would not affect other national assignments. In April, the leadership of the National Assembly had met with President Muhammadu Buhari in order to reconcile their differences to facilitate the passage of budget. President Buhari had presented the 2018 budget worth N8.6 trillion to a joint session of the National Assembly on November 7, 2017, with both chambers of the National Assembly promising to pass the budget on time. However, they claimed that differences between committees of both chambers and heads of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) forestalled the early passage of the budget. After the meeting, the president ordered all MDAs to resume the defence of the appropriation bill. He also directed all heads of MDAs to submit details of their budgets to the National Assembly for scrutiny.
