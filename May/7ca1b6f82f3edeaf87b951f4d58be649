The deputy governor of Bauchi State, Engr Nuhu Gidado, has resigned. This was disclosed in a letter he personally signed and addressed to the Governor, Mohammed Abubakar, yesterday. Gidado said that although he had planned to serve for just a term to deputise, he was resigning now because he has lost interest in the job and current administration. He said that his continued stay as deputy will not be fair and truthful to the governor as a brother and a leader. Gidado’s resignation brings the number of top officials of Governor Abubakar’s government to three. The commissioner for Budget and Planning, Shehu Ningi, had resigned in 2017. The special adviser to the governor on Investment, Samaila Sanusi, also resigned in March due to what he described as ‘unfriendly working environment.’ Recall that at about the same time that Sanusi resigned, the deputy caretaker chairman of Tafawa Balewa local government area, Munnir Yisin, also tendered his resignation.
