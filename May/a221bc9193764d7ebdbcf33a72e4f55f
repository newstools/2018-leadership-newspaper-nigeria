Southern senators almost succeeded in shutting down the executive bill seeking to empower the federal government to take over rivers and lakes across the country, as they expressed worry that it will further deplete the resources to the states and local governments in their regions. The Senators averred that the bill, which could have passed for third reading, contains detrimental provisions against the principles and practice of federalism in the country by way of further depleting the resources of states and local governments. A stalemate led the Senate presided over by the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, to mandate an ad- hoc committee comprising the chairman and vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Water Resources and those of Judiciary and Legal matters, and Director of Legal Services to look into the areas of controversy within one week and report back to the Senate on Wednesday May 30, 2018, for a way out. The report of the Bill titled “National Water Resources Bill, 2018,” was presented by the chairman of the senate committee on Water Resources, Ubali Shittu, Jigawa North East, who, while presenting the report said the Bill seeks to provide a regulatory framework for the water resources sector in Nigeria. He also said the Bill seeks to ensure that the nation’s water resources are protected, used, developed, conserved, managed and controlled. He added that it will further ensure the basic water needs of present and future generations of Nigerians. Speaking further, Ubali Shittu said the Bill will promote public-private partnerships in the development and management of water resources infrastructure, as well as improve public health and economic development.
