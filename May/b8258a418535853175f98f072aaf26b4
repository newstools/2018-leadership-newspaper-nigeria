A youth group, Coalition for good governance (CGG) has described Saturday’s endorsement of Alhaji Kabiru Taminu Turaki for the 2019 presidential election by the Kebbi state chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as highly commendable. The group in a statement by its coordinator, Vincent Michael said though, Mr Turaki is yet to publicly declare his intention to run for president, his endorsement shows that he is widely accepted as the man to lead the party to reclaim power in 2019 presidential election. The group therefore urged other Nigerians to rally support round the former minister to not only unseat the current APC led administration but to also bring about economic development that will provide jobs and improve standard of living. According to Vincent, the endorsement shows that Mr Turaki enjoys the support of his party and he is acceptable to the people. He said, “we are in a critical stage in our national development. There is no doubt that things are very bad. Actually, it has never been this bad. If the PDP is serious about reclaiming power, then it has to field formidable candidates with unblemished record capable of fixing Nigeria.
