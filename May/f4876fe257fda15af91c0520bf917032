Governor Nasir El-Rufai’s Spokesman, Mr.Samuel Aruwan, has said the results of the local government elections held last week Saturday using electronic voting machines clearly showed that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has done well in all the three senatorial districts of Kaduna State. Aruwan, who reacted over the official announcement of the results by the State electoral body,added that APC made a clean sweep of Zone 1, and dominant showing in Zone 2 and put up a decent fight in Zone 3 of the state. Recall that, the Kaduna State Independent Electoral Commission (KAD-SIECOM) had announced that APC won 14 local government areas,while PDP won 4, though other local government areas results still pending as polls rescheduled next month. Aruwan said:”The results of the LG elections clearly show that the APC has done well in all the three senatorial districts of Kaduna State. It made a clean sweep of Zone 1, made a dominant showing in Zone 2 and put up a decent fight in Zone 3. “The baseless demonization, persistent blackmail and deliberate misrepresentations perpetrated against Malam Nasir El-Rufai have failed miserably! “Governor Nasir Ahmad El-Rufai has set the pace and demonstrated political will to take local government election and administration to the next level. He has also strengthened and deepened democratization. The beauty of democracy is choice and the options it lay before the populace, but the ultimate oxygen, is the process that ensured votes cast count” Aruwan said.
