A group, Rebuild Nigeria International Forum, RNI, has described as demeaning, wicked and false, allegations of corruption against former vice-president and 2019 presidential hopeful, Atiku Abubakar, by those it called ‘certain political opportunists.’ RNI said that the allegations were made with the intention of truncating Atiku’s ambition, adding that Atiku is a worthy servant-leader, whose major drive is the emancipation of the generality of Nigerians from poverty. This position was contained in a statement signed by the forum’s director of Operations, Mr. Tayo Phillips, and made available to newsmen. RNI also vehemently debunked claims in some quarters that Atiku was shying away from travelling to the US for fear of being arrested for corruption. Phillips said, “It is the height of wickedness and jungle politicking for anyone to peddle that Atiku had not travelled to the US because he was afraid of facing corruption charges. “Within and outside the country, Atiku had maintained a clean slate and we want to reiterate that he had not found it necessary to be globetrotting in recent times, because of his patriotism to a country he had helped to build during his political career and which he also had to stay and help salvage from the hands of bad leaders.” The statement added, “It should also not be forgotten that Atiku was frontal to the establishment of the nation’s number one anti-graft agency, the Economy and Financial Crimes Commission,  EFCC, having been the person that brought its template from Brazil, and we wonder how some individuals could ever think that a man who did his all to ensure accountability and good governance could be corrupt.”
