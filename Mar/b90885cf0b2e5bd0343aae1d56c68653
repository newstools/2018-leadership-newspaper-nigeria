Former Senate President, Senator David Mark, has lamented over the killing of about 26 persons of Omusu community in Okpokwu Local Government Area of Benue State by suspected Fulani herdsmen. Mark made the lamentation in a statement signed by his Media Assistant, Paul Mumeh, and made available to newsmen yesterday in Abuja. According to the statement, Mark described as sad and frustrating, the killings in parts of Benue State despite repeated peace moves between the residents and the herdsmen in the state. He condemned the unwarranted killings of innocent citizens, pointing out that the crisis was degenerating to something akin to “war without end,” defying all peaceful approaches. He said: “I’m aware of various peace initiatives over the incessant clashes resulting to loss of lives and property. That the killings continue unabated is something beyond the ordinary. “Let me once again appealed to the assailants to sheathe their swords and allow peace to reign. Whichever side of the divide and whatever vocation you are engaged in, no progress can be made in a crisis-ridden environment.” Mark, who bemoaned the degenerating cases of insecurity in the land, said, “From abduction of innocent school girls in Dapchi, numerous cases of kidnapping to outright terrorism against unsuspecting citizens, the situation is frustrating. “We must all make concerted efforts to achieve peace in our communities. Our security agencies should rise up to the challenges and protect lives and property. Life is sacred and we must not take it for granted.”
