 The federal government has asked the Federal High Court in Abuja to freeze undeclared assets traced to the Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu. The federal government, in an ex-parte motion marked FHC/ABJ/CS/284/2018, asked the court for an interim court order “temporarily attaching/forfeiting the properties listed in Schedule B hereunder, to the Federal Government of Nigeria, pending the conclusion of further inquiry/investigation by the Special Presidential Investigation Panel for the Recovery of Public Property and/or possible arraignment of the Respondent”.  A Senior Advocate of Nigeria, MrFestus Keyamo, SAN, filed the motion on behalf of the government.
