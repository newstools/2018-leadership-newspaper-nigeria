The contractor handling the construction of the Yalo-Bashar-Dengi Road through Bauchi and Plateau States has assured of the capacity to complete the project on schedule provided the challenges that have stalled the construction of the bridges involved over time is resolved in good time. The Project Manager, Majdy Jarad who was speaking to the Ministerial Media Team put together by the Ministry of Power, Works and Housing to embark on an inspection tour of road and housing projects across the country as it continued its assignment through the Northeast said he is capable of delivering by the extended completion date of 27th July, 2018 only if the lingering bride issue is resolved quickly. The rehabilitation of Tumu-Pindiga-Kashere (Gombe State)-Futuk (Bauchi State) road and construction of Yalo-Bashar-Dengi section (Bauchi/Plateau States) contract No. 6214 with project length of 15km which was awarded to Rockbridge Construction Ltd at the sum of N3, 076, 381,622, 747.2 with the commencement date of 30th January, 2014 is currently at 49.56 per cent completion. With the initial completion date of 29th July, 2015 extended to 27th July, 2018, the contract period became 54 months, and so far the percentage time lapse is 89 per cent. The initial plan for the three span bridges of 15 metre each involved in the project was construct them with 45 metre breadth, but along the line it was realised that the water s across which the bridges are to be built tend to change their course through seasons, and there was a call for a new arrangement to have them built at 100 metres breadth in order to avoid any problem that may result from the change of course in future. Jarad who told the team that he has fund challenge with the ministry at all, and that he has about a hundred indigenous employees including two engineers working with him said “If the bridge issue is resolved today, we will start working on it immediately, and hopefully by the end of July we should be finishing the project.” However, the Director of Works, Northeast Zone, Engr Rufai said the bridge issue is almost resolved by the concerned unit in the ministry, adding that a new approach will soon be adopted to ensure that the contractor continues the work without further hitches. Another project visited in the area same day by the team is the Gombe-Numan-Yola road phase 2 being handled by Triacta Nigeria Ltd since 24th January, 2015 at a contract sum of over N7 billion with an extended completion date 23rd December, 2019, currently at 47 per cent completion.
