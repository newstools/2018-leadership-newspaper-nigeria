The Niger State governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, has revealed why the governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC) are insisting on second tenure for President Muhammadu Buhari, saying that only the continuation of his presidency beyond 2019 could help solve the enormous challenges confronting the country. The governor, who made this known yesterday when he received the people of his hometown, Kontagora, at Government House, Minna, during a solidarity visit, said if President Buhari refuses to contest in 2019, the country will go backward in its development. “If President Muhammadu Buhari resists to contest in 2019, there will be problem in solving the enormous challenges facing the country because he is truthful, fair and just in administering the nation”, he said. He noted that the APC governors declared support for President Buhari to ensure the continuity and sustainability of his effort in reviving the country economically and freeing the nation from the clutches of corruption. On the call by the people of Kontagora for him to recontest in 2019, Governor Bello stated that the call has strengthened his desire to provide more dividends of democracy to the electorate. He gave assurance to his townspeople that he would complete all the ongoing projects in Kontagora town within the year, which include the dam for the water board, Nursing School, Kontagora, Civil Defense School, renovation of schools as well other initiatives to create jobs and assist businesses in the area.
