The immediate past interim national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Ahmed Mohmmed Makarfi has denied the allegation that he voted the presidential candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2015. A former Niger Delta militant, Alhaji Asari Dokubo had alleged, among other things that Senator Ahmed Makarfi voted for the APC in the 2015 presidential elections and that he (Makarfi) flaunted his ballot paper for all to see. A statement by his media aide, Muhktar Sirajo, said “Ordinarily, this is an issue we shouldn’t dignify with a response, but sometimes falsehoods have a way of taking a life of their own and it is not beyond some unscrupulous politicians to splash mud on the integrity of others in order to gain undue advantage.” “Senator Makarfi has remained a PDP man to the core, sticking with the party through thick and thin and maintaining his faith in it even at a time when defection was the easy way out. “He has never hidden his gratitude to the PDP for the platform and opportunity it has afforded him to become what he has become and has never, for a second, on account of any slight he felt he suffered or for any other reason, even toyed with the idea of abandoning it let alone teaming up with others to bring it to ruination.”
