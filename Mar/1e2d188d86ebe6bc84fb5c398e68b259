Nigeria’s First Lady, Aisha Buhari has showered praise on the remarkable efforts of surgeons and staff of Cedarcrest Hospital, Abuja, who helped to save the life of her only son,  Yusuf Buhari, after sustaining injuries on a motorbike in December 2017, saying even after he was flown abroad they did nothing for him. Aisha disclosed this yesterday while speaking at the commissioning ceremony and launching of Cedarcrest GAUIS foundation. She said even after her son was flown abroad for further medical attention,  they did not do anything for him as he was already cured by Cedarcrest hospital. “He almost lost his life but this hospital saved him.  Even after he was flown abroad for further medical attention, they did not do anything for him, asking where the accident and the surgery took place. We told them Nigeria and they say excellent. So many doctors made the same comments.” While further commending them for the courage and perseverance to make sure the hospital came into existence to save lives, she said Nigerians should believe in their own. “I believe in making Nigeria a better place,  I don’t believe in spending our resources abroad,  after all we have all the professionals, we have all it takes to have a hospital like this,” she added. She further called on the management of the hospital to make it affordable for all Nigerians. Also speaking, the medical director of Cedarcrest Hospital, Dr Felix Ogedegbe said the aim of the hospital is to bring home the kind of specialised medical services they have seen and trained outside the country. According to him, the hospital is a 90 bed facility built to incorporate an emergency/ trauma centre, a helipad,  major radiology diagnostic centre, a prosthetic manufacturing plant,  an oxygen manufacturing plant,  modular surgical operating theatres, cardiac catheterization unit and several other facilities that make for a modern multispecialty hospital.
