President Muhammadu Buhari is expected to, on March 27, personally visit Borno state to unveil the Wal-Wanne rice pyramid at Ramat Muhammad Square, Maiduguri. Confirming this development, the Senior Special Adviser, Media, to the Buhari Campaign Organisation (BCO), Alhaji Garba Dangida, said the feat showed the commitment of the present administration to the campaign promise of reducing poverty in the country and boost agriculture.

The unveiling underscores the need to showcase agriculture to unemployed youths as an enterprise and the imperative of returning to the farm to guarantee wealth creation and food security.
