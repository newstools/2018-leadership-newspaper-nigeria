It was a drama yesterday when the Governor of Kogi State,  Alhaji Yahaya Bello dissolved his cabinet and less than 30 minutes later,  reversed the decision. The governor, who arrived at Lokoja yesterday from Abuja, sacked his 15 commissioners and the 21 Local Government Administrators during a meeting. He directed all affected officials  to summit keys of  their oficial vehicles to   the,  Mrs Folashade Arike. However, less than 30 minutes, the governor reversed his decision to sack both the cabinet and the 21 local government administrators. Rather, he directed that all members should continue to work with him  and ordered that the status quo be maintained. The governor was said to have demanded better performance and better relationship between the appointees and the masses. Director General Media and Publicity to the governor Mr. Kingsly Fanwo in a chat with newsmen said “The Governor has reversed himself on the direction on dissolution.”
