Nigerian Air Force (NAF) training aircraft has crashed in Kaduna with no casualty. An eyewitness confirmed that the plane crash landed in Kauran Dawa, a village in Lere local government area of Kaduna State. Meanwhile, a press statement issued by the director of Public Relations and Information, Nigerian Air Force headquarters, Air Vice Marshal Olatokunbo Adesanya, stated that “A Nigerian Air Force (NAF) student pilot has force landed a Diamond 40 Trainer Aircraft on the outskirts of Kaduna while on a solo mission, as part of flying training at the 401 Flying Training School, Kaduna. “The incident, which took place today, 19 March 2018, was as a result of an airborne emergency that could not enable the pilot fly the aircraft back to the Base. He therefore force landed the aircraft but with minimal damage to it. “However, the student pilot, who was the only one on board, suffered minor injuries and is already receiving treatment at the 461 Nigerian Air Force Hospital, Kaduna.” The statement also said the chief of the air staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, has immediately directed the constitution of a board of inquiry to determine the exact cause of the incident while efforts are ongoing to recover the aircraft.
