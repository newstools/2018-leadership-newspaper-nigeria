The Minister of State for Aviation, Sen. HadiSirika said the federal government is set to pay the N45billion entitlements of ex-workers of the defunct Nigeria Airways Limited. Sirika  explained that the government had already earmarked the funds and that the  delay in payment is because the Senate is yet to approve it and urged the former staff to be patient, as the Senate has promised to approve it after the Easter break. Speaking at the 4th Aviation Stakeholders Forum yesterday in Abuja, the minister said the payment would be done within two weeks after the Senate approves it. Addressing the participants, the minister said: “Because of the law and because we did everything transparently and in accordance with the law, we put out a request to the National Assembly to allow us to pay them. “It has passed the House of Representatives but it is remaining the Senate. The Senate promised to pass it when they come back from Easter and once they pass it, we will pay. “Nigeria Airways,  we will pay you and we thank you for your patience.” Recall that labour unions in the aviation industry had threatened to ground flight operations all over the country to draw government’s attention to the plight of ex-workers of the defunct Nigeria Airways Limited.‎ The unions gave the federal government 14 days ultimatum which began on March 19, for it to make the payment or they would down tools.
