Remittal consultants, a firm contracted to implement the e-payment of salaries in Benue state has identified 500 ghost workers on the payroll of the state civil service. The committee on the declaration of state of emergency on salary issues in the agrarian state is headed by the Deputy Governor, Benson Abounu. the Deputy Governor, Abounu while appearing before the Benue State House of Assembly testified that the consultants have also, fished out 250 personal sub-head numbers that were duplicated to the identified 500 ghost workers on the payroll. He said the discovery was achieved through a system analysis which was immediately corrected by the committee. However, the chairman, State Universal Basic Education Board, SUBEB, Rev Philip Tachin, who also appeared before the House, said since the consultants took over payment of salaries from SUBEB in 2017, the abnormalities that usually characterized payment of salaries have been eliminated. It would be recalled that the Benue State House of Assembly had earlier summoned the consultant, the chairman committee on state emergency on salary issues with others involved, to testify about the discrepancies in the January salary payment which was handled by the firm.
