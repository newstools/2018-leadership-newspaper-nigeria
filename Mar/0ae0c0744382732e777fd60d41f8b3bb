The National Association of Polytechnic Students (NAPS) and the Coalition of Concerned HND Holders (CCHH) have called on President Muhammadu Buhari and the National Assembly to help resolve issues surrounding the dichotomy in HND/BSC certificates. National vice president, NAPS, Mr Damola Olugbode who spoke with journalists in Abuja yesterday said the dichotomy had been the motivation for several industry crisis in both public and private sectors. While stressing that the bill seeking to stop the age long dichotomy had passed through second reading in the House of Representatives, he called for the bill to be passed into law expediently. According to him, for many years “we have been grossly marginalised and sidelined by the federal government especially the various ministers of education.”
He said, “The Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics (ASUP) had at various times voiced out and protested about the treatment of HND graduates in all sectors of the Nigerian labour market, yet nothing has been done. “Polytechnic education is now being regarded as vocational studies, as witnessed by several professional bodies that have refused to recognised HND, yet accredit the same courses of study at the Polytechnics. ‘’ The HND/BSC dichotomy still survives this long due to poor implementation of policy statement. “We therefore, urge President Muhammadu Buhari, the Federal Executive Council, National Assembly and the National Council on Establishment to champion millions of Nigerian youths who have been disenfranchised by this policy.” Olugbode however, called for the autonomy of Polytechnics education in Nigeria as theories without practical was nothing but manipulations while calling for HND and BSC to be treated the same. Also speaking, the acting president, National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) Mr Abdulwahab Agboola noted that high level manpower was being produced in Polytechnics every year adding that these products are now subjected to ridicule in their places of work.
