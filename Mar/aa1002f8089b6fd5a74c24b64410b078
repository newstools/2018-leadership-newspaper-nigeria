Efforts to foil the abduction of the mother of a Katsina oil magnate, Hajia Diya Abdullahi, 85, came to a sour end at the weekend when the gunmen injured her husband, Alhaji Abdullahi, who tried to bar them from whisking the octogenarian away. Also injured by the suspected kidnappers was one of the neighbours of the Abdullahis, Alhaji Usman Barkiya, who was shot twice by the gunmen. Barkiya, who was on hand to stop the hoodlums from escaping with the elderly women in his truck, when the get-away motorcycle of the suspects broke down, was left in the pool of his blood following the gunshot wounds he reportedly sustained in his stomach and hand. Investigations revealed that the drama, which surrounded the abduction of the octogenarian by the desperate five-man gangsters, occurred shortly after midnight on Friday in Bayan quarters, Dutsinma town. Sources further revealed that the injured victims were rushed to the Dutsinma General Hospital after the abduction, adding that the kidnappers were yet to demand the ransom for the release of the mother of the chief executive of Shema Petroleum, Alhaji Nagogo Mamman. The spokesman of the Katsina State Police Command, Isah Gambo, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), who confirmed the incident, assured that the police had spread their drag net for the suspects and all efforts are geared towards the rescue of the elderly woman.
