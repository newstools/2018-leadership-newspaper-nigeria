 Bandits have laid an ambush on troops in Birnin Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State, killing 11 soldiers and wounding three. LEADERSHIP gathered that the bandits laid siege on the troops at Kampanin Doka village of Birnin Gwari on Tuesday night.  The soldiers are among a special detachment of troops sent to the village to ensure security for expatriates and others working on a new road linking Zamfara State with Kaduna through Dansadau-Dangulbi and Birnin Gwari. It would be recalled that one of the foreign engineers working at the site was last year kidnapped by unknown gun men but was later released. After that incident, all the workers, including the expatriates fled the site but were mobilized to come back on the conditions that will be provided security.  A former vice chairman of the local government who pleaded anonymity said the bandits attacked the soldier’s camp between 9pm on Tuesday, killing 11. “We gathered that the soldiers had caught a thief in a village called Maganda in the area and were taking him back to their camp when some personnel of the Nigerian Police Force (NPF) asked them to hand over the thief to them which the soldiers refused.  “The same police followed the soldiers to their camp in Kampanin Doka and again asked them to hand over the thief to them, but the soldiers still refused. Around 9 pm on Tuesday, bandits attacked the Army troop in the camp,” he said. He added that “members of the community kept calling us when the attack was taking place, but there was nothing we could do since we don’t have any weapons, all we did was to alert the emir and other security personnel with the hope that they could come to their aid. “I can confirm that 11 Soldiers were killed by the bandits,” he said.
