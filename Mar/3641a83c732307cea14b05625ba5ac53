Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to suspend Minister of Communications, Adebayo Shittu over allegations of sleaze. In a statement made available to newsmen, HURIWA also enjoined the president to direct the nation’s anti-graft agencies to commence immediate investigations of the minister ‘following allegations of sleazy dealings made against him by his trusted aide’. It would be recalled that Mr. Victor Oluwadamilare, Special Assistant on Media to Mr Shittu, had alleged that his boss in the course of his 29 months as minister, had bought 12 luxury houses mostly in Abuja, Lagos and Ibadan, and had acquired at least 25 exotic cars within the same period. The former media aide who accused Shittu of excessive greed and monumental corruption also alleged that only recently, the minister bought a brand new printing press for N93million . Although the minister denied the allegations, HURIWA expressed consternation that the President has done nothing about the allegation. “These allegations are not difficult or too complex to unravel because the man who has made them is said to be a very trusted personal staff of the minister who is willing to help the prosecution to ensure that the real facts behind these allegations are obtained.” “The allegations if found to be true then the minister must be sacked and prosecuted to serve as strong deterrent. This is the time for the government to act decisively to demonstrate a departure from the corrupt practice of protecting top ranking Presidency officials from investigations and effective prosecution. “We are by this media statement urging the President to take a number of measures against the communications minister by suspending him from office and to order comprehensive investigations by all the relevant anti-graft agencies to guide against compromise”.
