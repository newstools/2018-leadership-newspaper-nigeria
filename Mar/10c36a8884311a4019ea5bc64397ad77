Speaking to journalists at the weekend, the  deputy governor of Niger state,Alhaji Ahmad Muhammad Ketso stated that the reports will be handed over to the security agents to prove that the present APC government in Niger state was never a place for looters. The deputy governor whose  disclosure  was premised on the recent statement allegedly made by the immediate past Governor of Niger state, Dr Muazu Babangida Aliyu  that the APC was also entertaining looters in their ranks, noted that by the time the security agents finished their job “ we will see who is the Chief looter of Niger state”. According to him, some of the missing  money of the civil servants deducted for the CPS was traced to private accounts and that the government is set to make sure that the security agents and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC takes over from that point. Ketso  stated that it was sad that people’s contribution  made out of hardwork could be so siphoned under the watch of the immediate past  governor and  he still had not shown remorse for such act. He stated that the administration of Abubakar Sani Bello will continue to pursue its Restoration agenda for the state and will not be distracted, saying that the government had finished some uncompleted projects left by the previous government that were found viable and have direct positive bearing on the lives of the people..
