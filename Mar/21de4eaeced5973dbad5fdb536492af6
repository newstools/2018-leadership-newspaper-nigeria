The long awaited electricity meter regulation has been released by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Agency (NERC). Presenting it this Saturday before members of the administrative cadre in the Ministry of Power, Works and Housing on the second and last day of their 2018 retreat being chaired by the Hon. Minister, Babatunde Fashola in Kano, the Vice-Chairman of NERC, Engr Sanusi Garba said the regulation has come to plug the huge metering gap and fast-track metering of all electricity customers with a view to putting an end to issues arising from estimated billing. According to him, the introduction of the regulation now means that private investors apart from the distribution companies (DisCos) willing investors can procure meters in understanding with the concerned DisCos to recoup their monies with time through specified charges incorporated into electricity bills. He said under the regulation the N39 billion recently approved by the Federal executive council (FEC) will be loaned to certified investors on application.
