The Minister of Finance, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun, says media misrepresented her innocuous letter to the acting chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mr. Ibrahim Magu, on cash recoveries by the federal government. The Minister, in a statement yesterday, said the letter dated 9th February, 2018 which was leaked to the public is a standard letter aimed at improving controls over the recovered funds. “There is no ulterior motive behind the letter as alleged in some media reports but to enable the reconciliation and harmonisation of the figures on recovered funds by the Government,” the minister said in a statement issues by her spokesman, Oluyinka Akintunde. Adeosun said for the avoidance of doubt, the EFCC has subsequently provided the requested information and reconciliation is ongoing.
