There is hope on the horizon for Nigeria’s industrialisation as a steel rolling company, Premium Steel and Mines Limited has opened in Delta State. The rolling steel section of the company, which is an offshoot of the old Delta Steel Company, was commissioned at the weekend by the Delta State governor, Ifeanyi Okowa. The managing director and chief executive officer of the company, Mr. Prasanta Mishra said that other sections of the company would also takeoff at the shortest possible time, emphasising that the company will develop to make Nigeria the hub of rolling steel business in Africa. Governor Okowa urged the management of the new company to always comply with the local content policy of government, stressing that the host communities should be engaged in relevant undertakings of the company. It would be recalled that the former Delta Steel Company Oviwian –Aladja had been moribund for the past 20 years before its resuscitation by the Asset Management Company of Nigeria (AMCON). The minister of Solid Minerals, Dr. Kayode Fayemi said that the rebirth of the steel company underscores the commitment of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration to develop the extractive sector of the economy towards a comprehensive industrialisation in Nigeria.
