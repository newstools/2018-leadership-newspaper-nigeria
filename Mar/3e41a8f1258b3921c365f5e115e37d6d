A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and leader of the Abia State caucus of the party, Chief Sam Nkire has described as false and without foundation, the rumour that he was on his way out of the ruling party. In a statement signed by Nkire, which was made available to LEADERSHIP yesterday, the party chieftain said, “I am still in APC and will remain in APC for some time to come.” He maintained that as a founding member of the party, he remains a  member of the party’s board of trustees, as well as a member of the national caucus and leader of the Abia State caucus of the APC, until the end of June 2018 when the  party would hold its national convention. Nkire described as cheap and insulting, the rumour that he was leaving the party because he had not been favoured with any political appointment, adding, “I have in the 30 years been in the limelight and therefore I think that I may have had enough of political appointments.” According to him, “Our political leaders must begin to see things differently and be able to tell their followers that not everybody must have political appointment all the time.” He advised all those who still feel neglected to continue to be patient, while keeping faith with the party, as according to him, “APC reward system is bound to improve next time around.”
