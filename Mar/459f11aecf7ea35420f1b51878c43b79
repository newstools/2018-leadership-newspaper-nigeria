A former defence minister, General Theophilus Danjuma (retd), has paid a visit to the hilltop residence of former military president, Gen Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (retd). A source close to the residence told LEADERSHIP Weekend yesterday that T.Y. Danjuma’s entourage was received at the Minna airport by an IBB delegation stationed at the airport. The source hinted that when the former defence minister arrived at the hilltop residence at Minna, he went upstairs straight to the inner chamber of Babangida’s house. It was believed that Danjuma visited IBB over the latter’s ill-health. The source described the coming and departure of General Danjuma as discrete and without the usual fanfare at IBB’s house during social visits of such nature.
