President Muhammdu Buhari has surprisingly declared that after due consultations, the tenure extension that was approved for the National Working Committee (NWC) and the state chairmen of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC), was against the constitution of the party even as he said that going against it will further widen the cracks within the rank and file of the party. The President, who apparently took the NEC members unawares in the sudden u-turn in his decision, declared the tenure extension unconstitutional and called for a speedy resolution of the outstanding issues so as to make the party a strong fighting force that will best suit the populace. LEADERSHIP had penultimate Monday, exclusively reported that top on the agenda for discussion at the NEC will be to consider the appropriateness or otherwise of the tenure extension, a decision which gave a one year tenure elongation for the partyâ€™s leadership both at the states and national levels which had been generating more controversies. Recall that the party had come under increasing fire since its last NEC on February 27, exactly a month ago when it approved an extension for the Chief John Odigie Oyegun led National Working Committee and state executive committees of the party for another one year with effect from June 2018.
