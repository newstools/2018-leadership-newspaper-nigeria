The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has calmed frayed nerves of candidates who sat for the just concluded Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), urging them to be patient as the result will be released soon. The Board’s spokeperson, Dr Fabian Benjamin, who spoke during an interview yesterday, stated that JAMB is doing everything it can to ensure that the result is posted in its website without delay. Benjamin said that modalities are being put in place to ensure all the results are transparent and accurate. He reiterated that the board is delaying some of the results because each has to undergo total scrutiny before being posted on its website to avoid cancellations later. He also assured that all technical difficulties encountered to access the website are being addressed. Many of the candidates, who sat for the examinations, have complained that while some have seen theirs, they were yet to see their own results. “I was scared that maybe something has gone wrong because my friend said she has seen hers. I took the exam on March 11, 2018. But I was told to be patient that other results will be out soon,” Tochukwu Ugwu, one of the candidates said.
