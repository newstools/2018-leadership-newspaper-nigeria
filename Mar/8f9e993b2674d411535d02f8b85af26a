The Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) has suspended two officers, Araoyinbo Oluwadare and Gabriel Awosanmi, over their alleged involvement in  facilitating and abetting an attempted trafficking of six underage girls. NIS public relations officer (PRO), Mr Sunday James, revealed this yesterday in a statement obtained by LEADERSHIP Weekend. It was gathered that Oluwadare, a senior inspector of immigration, and Awosanmi, an immigration assistant, were arrested at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Lagos, on Thursday night. They were alleged to have facilitated an attempted trafficking of six underage girls to Oman and Kuwait through an Ethiopian Airlines flight. Investigations further revealed that luck ran out of them when a team of aviation security personnel at the airport apprehended them. According to NIS statement, the comptroller-general of immigration, Muhammad Babandede, ordered the suspension of the duo from duty with immediate effect in line with Service rules and regulations. The suspension, according to the statement, was to allow for detailed investigation into the issue with a view to unravelling their level of culpability and indeed other syndicates involved in the act. The comptroller-general further assured the public of the management’s commitment to the eradication of smuggling of migrants and trafficking of persons.
