The Concerned Democratic Initiative Movement For Good Governance (CDIMGG) has condemned the suspension of 10 Pro-Buhari Senators who opposed the amendment of the 2019 general election time table set by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)  by the Senate. The CDIMGG in a statement by its national coordinator, Ado Mallam Rossi and made available to LEADERSHIP in Abuja yesterday alleged that the Senate President, Bukola Saraki may be working for the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to sabotage the All Progressives Congress (APC) agenda using his allies within the APC to stagnate all development programmes and appointments proposed by the Buhari led administration. The group also alleged that the Senate President is leading the lawmakers trying to sabotage the recent reconciliation of the APC embarked upon by the national leader of the party, Bola Ahmed Tinubu who was given the assignment by President Muhammadu Buhari. The group alleged that Saraki and his allies attempt to frustrate this effort has further confirmed their alliance with PDP to cripple and make sure that President Muhammadu Buhari do not contest and become victorious in the 2019 general election. It called on the leadership of the Senate to immediately withdraw the suspension of the 10 senators because it violates the constitution and noted that the Senate President had been undergoing trial at the Code of Conduct Tribunal yet he was not suspended by the Senate. The group threatened to embark on protest by occupying and halting all Senate activities until the human rights of the suspended Senators are respected by Saraki. It urged the national leadership of APC to sanction and also dismiss those involved in frustrating efforts to reconcile party members including those working with PDP to see to the downfall of Buhari administration in the National Assembly.
