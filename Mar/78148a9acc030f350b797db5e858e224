The Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Onnoghen, yesterday described corrupt judges as disgrace to the entire judiciary in the country. The CJN who spoke at the 2018 Refreshers Course for Judges and Khadis organised by the National Judicial Institute stated that it is for this reason that the National Judicial Council (NJC) has constituted Corruption and Financial Crimes Cases Trial Monitoring Committee (COTRIMCO). He said the committee, which has hit the ground running, would serve as a check on the excesses of some bad eggs in the judiciary. “My Lords, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, you will all agree with me that a corrupt judge is not only a disgrace to the Bench and the noble profession but is also a disaster to the course of justice and the nation. “I must not fail to emphasise that my definition of corruption is not limited to bribe-taking but also includes the giving of judgement or orders based on any consideration other than legal merit. It is gratifying to note that the National Judicial Council is already tackling the cankerworm head-on”. CJN Onnoghen also noted that the setting up of special courts to handle corruption cases is a right step in the right direction, saying it will help in the expeditious hearing of corruption cases. He continued: “The designation of special courts to handle corruption cases is also a step in the right direction as lingering corruption cases will be expeditiously dispensed with. It will no longer be business as usual. “I must state categorically however, lest I am accused of the fallacy of hasty generalisation, that the judiciary in Nigeria is not corrupt or inefficient. It is an established fact that the Judiciary in Nigeria is as good as the best anywhere in the world. Only few judges are found wanting”.
