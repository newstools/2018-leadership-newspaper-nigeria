Operation Saran Daji, a military joint operation fighting banditry activities in Zamfara State, has arrested two females and 50 bandits terrorising people of the state. Addressing a press briefing in Gusau, the Zamfara State capital, acting director, Defense Information, Brigadier General John Agim, said the operation also nabbed suspected logistics suppliers of the bandits. “A point of emphasis is the arrest of chief logistics suppliers identified as Amos Ugwuozo, Nura Mukhtari and Sani Yaro,” he added. According to him, robust patrols and armed escorts around vulnerable villages and weekly local markets, have built confidence in the communities and therefore, bandits no longer have the freedom of action. “Activities of our troops had led to the recovery of 1000 rustled cattle that were returned to the owners,” he stressed. Agim, however, acknowledged the efforts of the Air Task Force for launching air attacks at Sububu and Rugu forest where the bandits were hiding. He explained that the attacks have succeeded in neutralising large bandits and destroying their camps. The DDI further said the return of over 6000 displaced persons to their communities was a clear indication that peace has started returning to the state. He also solicited the support of the local communities to provide useful information to the Operaration Sharan Daji so that they can continue to successfully contain the security challenge.
