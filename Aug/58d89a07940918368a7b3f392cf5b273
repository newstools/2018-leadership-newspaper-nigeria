Former Director General of the Department of State Service (DSS) Lawal Daura has allegedly said he was not a mole during his time as the head of the Service. A report, attributed to PRNigeria claimed that a close associate of the sacked DSS boss who spoke to PRNigeria on condition of anonymity said that Daura insisted that he took all actions in national interest adding that it was a collective effort involving principal officers of sister agencies. Daura however promised not to disclose on whose authority he laid siege on the National Assembly. The source further said that “while the former DSS boss has not officially handed over up till now, his house both in Asokoro and Gwarinpa were thoroughly searched in the night and nothing incriminating were found, and all items found including necklace, praying mat, CDs, ATM card, women bags, documents and receipts have been duly returned to him accordingly.” PRNigeria also noted that the source who is also close to security agencies pointed out that: “Spymasters all over the world can be sacrificed but not to the extent of rubbishing their integrity and reputation on the altar of political considerations, especially a spymaster created by the same system, considering the delicate and sensitive nature of intelligent services.” It would be recalled that the interim report submitted by the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Ibrahim Idris to the then acting president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo had allegedly noted that Daura, has confessed that he deployed hooded Operatives of the Secret Service to the National Assembly complex based on intelligence report that unauthorised persons were planning to smuggle dangerous weapons and incriminating items into the Federal Legislative complex. Part of the report reads, “The former Director-General, Department of State Security Services, DSS, Lawal Daura, acted unilaterally, without informing the Presidency. He did not share or intimate other Security Agencies on the unlawful operations.”
