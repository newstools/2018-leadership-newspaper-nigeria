The senator from Anambra South senatorial district of Anambra State, Stella Oduah, yesterday, explained that she defected from the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to the ruling All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in her state so as to reposition herself strategically to contribute more to the development of the state. Oduah, who was at the state headquarters of APGA in Awka, where she met with the state executive members of the party, told newsmen after the meeting that the state governor, Willie Obiano, has done so much to develop the state and as such, has earned the support of any patriotic citizen of the state. “I left the PDP to join APGA to enable me join forces with the Anambra State governor who is the chairman of the board of trustees of the party, Victor Umeh, APGA national chairman, Victor Oye and other stakeholders of the party, to ensure effective representation of the good people of my senatorial zone, as well as bring more development to Anambra State.” The serving senator during the meeting, declared her intention to seek re-election to the Red chamber of the National Assembly in the 2019 elections to the Norbert Obi led state executive of the party.  She maintained that judging from her score-card in the over three years she had been in the senate, she had justified the trust reposed on her by the people of her senatorial district. She appealed to the party’s state executives that she would seek re-election under the party platform and urged them to give the necessary support to help her realise her ambition.
