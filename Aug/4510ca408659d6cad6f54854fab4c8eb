He noted that as technology has become the focus of financial service delivery, the bank would continue to offer outstanding financial solutions that would be “anchored on a superb combination of technology and human touch for easy, fast and secure banking.” On the outlook for the 2018 financial year, he said, “The succeeding year will be challenging from the perspective of competition, which traditionally evokes the best in us.” “The year will come with its challenges and opportunities considering the highly competitive nature of the Nigerian market, the dynamics of contemporary service provision and variable customer expectations.” As a strategy towards mitigating the impact of the challenging environment, the Zenith Bank GMD said the management of the bank would increase the quality of its engagement and be more proactive by anticipating fluctuations in the economy and markets.
