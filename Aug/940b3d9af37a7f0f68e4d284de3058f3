The All Progressives Congress (APC) has urged electorates to resist desperate politicians and their political parties’ allegedly bent on deploying illegal, undemocratic and sinister means, including violence to manipulate elections. The party further said that the call came against the backdrop of the recent seizure of a Nigerian-bound ship detained in South Africa for carrying arms and explosives and the earlier arms’ seizures by the Nigeria Customs Service. This was contained in a statement issued on Sunday by its Acting National Publicity Secretary, Mr Yekini Nabena. The statement reads in part: “This is a red-flag security agencies must note and be alert to as political activities heighten in the leadup to coming elections.  We invite the opposition to wake up to new realities where votes count and the people’s will prevail in all elections. “We also call on all well-meaning Nigerians to support ongoing progressive efforts by the President Muhammadu Buhari-led APC administration to ensure that our elections are transparent, free, fair and credible. “Finally, we call on the National Assembly to urgently do the needful by reconvening to consider and pass the 2019 election budget of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). We condemn any attempt to weaken INEC ahead of the 2019 election,”
