Aliyu Omeiza, the official driver to the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed has denied social media report that he abandoned the minister on the road in Abuja and decamped to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). In a telephone interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Wednesday evening, Omeiza said the report was fake because such incident did not happen. “It is a lie, Nothing like that happened. I drove my Oga to the Villa in the morning where he attended the Federal Executive Council meeting. ” We also went to some other places with all the security details before I closed for work. “I am not a politician, I do not belong to any political party, not to talk of decamping. “This is an example of fake news that Oga has been talking about,” he said. Omeiza who said he has been driving the minister for years said he has no reason to leave the minister because he has been so good to him.(NAN)
