A group of lawmakers in the House of Representatives under the auspices of Parliamentary Democrats Group (PDG) has welcomed President Muhammadu Buhari from his vacation with an appeal on him to order the arrest of the All Progressives Congress (APC) national chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole saying he is a threat to the country’s democracy. The group in a statement signed by its spokesman, Hon Timothy Golu said that since Oshiomhole assumed the chairman of the APC, he has employed primitive ways to denigrate the institution of the National Assembly just to achieve a wishful thought that is alien to democracy. The group frowns at the party leader’s action which according to it, is “bringing disgrace to Nigeria as a continental giant of democracy”. The PDG said:  “Oshiomhole has refused to sleep because he wants Senator Bukola Saraki removed as duly elected Senate President.” It also accused the APC national chairman of working tirelessly to scuttle the current democracy through his utterances and activities. “He is distracting our nation’s democracy and ridiculing us before the global democratic community. His style is too primitive for democracy. “Let him come through the door with 2/3 of the Senators to legally achieve his selfish objective. What his ignorance would not allow him know is that even some APC Senators are not part of the charade. Access to democracy is not brigandage but respect to the rule of law and due process. “Oshiomhole’s anti democratic utterances is making us a laughing stock. We advise him not to kill himself on Saraki as there is nothing he can do to subvert the law of democracy just to achieve an anti democratic goal. “We call on President Buhari to immediately call him to order or direct the IGP Ibrahim Idris to arrest him so that peace can flow. “He is destabilising the National Assembly with threats and the use of security agencies to haunt our leaders.”
