In his letter of resignation, the erstwhile publicity secretary of APC, Sulyman Buhari said his resignation was occasioned by an alleged “ indirect fuelling of crises in Kwara APC chapter by the national leadership of the party.” He added that there was also lack of reward system in the party” we toiled to build from the scratch. “All efforts to get the chairman of the party in the state, Hon. Ishola Balogun- Fulani, for his comment on the development proved futile as the time of filing this report. Though, the national leadership of APC had dissolved the Balogun – Fulani led executive of APC in Kwara state, an Ilorin High Court had nullified that decision and restrained the chairman of the caretaker committee put in place by the NWC, Hon. Bashir Bolarinwa from parading himself as the party’s chairman.
