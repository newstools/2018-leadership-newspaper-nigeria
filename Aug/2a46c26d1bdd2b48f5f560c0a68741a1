Attempts by unknown gunmen to attack the Ukana, Essien Udim local government area residence of the Senator representing Akwa Ibom North West senatorial district, Senator Godswill Akpabio have been repelled by gallant policemen attached to the former Senate Minority Leader. Eye witness account said the Senator was holding political meetings on Tuesday night at his country home when unknown gunmen numbering
about 10 stormed his residence and shot sporadically causing stampede. According to our source, the incident brought the meeting into a temporary halt as those present in the meeting scampered for safety while the shooting continued unabated. A retired deputy inspector general of Police, Mr Udom Ekpoudom who was also present at the political meeting at the time of the incident was seen making frantic calls for security beef up to help repel the attack.
However security men attached to the resident after recovering from the initial shock were said to have responded gallantly with superior fire power which forced a retreat from the invading attackers. According to Mr Raymond Inim who witnessed the incident said, “We were holding a meeting with our leader, Senator Akpabio when suddenly people who were not part of the meeting ran into the Senator’s banquet hall where the meeting was held. “The Senator inquired to know
the cause of the commotion and before someone could explain, sounds of sporadic gun shots rented the air. It lasted for a while before the situation was brought under control and we had to end the meeting abruptly.” It was not immediately clear what the motives of the attackers were but eye witnesses said the gestapo manner the gunmen struck and disappeared called for security beef up around the former Senate Minority Leader who recently defected from the Peoples Democratic Party to the ruling All Progressives Congress.
