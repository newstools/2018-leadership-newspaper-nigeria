The remains of the wife of former minister of Defence, Gen Aliyu Mohammed Gusau (rtd), Hajia Binta Aliyu, was yesterday laid to rest in Kaduna with about six serving governors in attendance. Hajiya Binta Aliyu died at a London Hospital after a protracted illness. Aside the serving governors who attended the burial rites, other dignitaries including traditional rulers, military generals (serving and retired), and former governors were also present to pay their last respect. Prayers were said for the repose of her soul at the Yahaya Road Mosque, Kaduna, while her remains were interred at the Ungwan Sarki Cemetery at about 1:30 pm. Among the dignitaries who were at General Gusauâ€™s residence to pay their last respect are state governors, Malam Nasir El-Rufai, Kaduna; Umar Ganduje, Kano; Aminu Tambuwal, Sokoto; Tanko Al-Makura, Nasarawa; Ibrahim Dankwambo, Gombe; and Mohammed Umar Jibrilla, Adamawa.

Speaking shortly after the burial, governor of Adamawa State, Jibrilla, described the late Hajia Binta as a loving and caring wife, mother and grandmother who has left a vacuum that will be difficult to fill in a long time. He prayed Allah to grant her soul Aljanatu Firdausi and strength for the family to bear the irreparable loss.
