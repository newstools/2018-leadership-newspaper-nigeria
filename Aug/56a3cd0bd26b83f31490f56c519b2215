Ogun State Governor Abikunle Amosun yesterday enjoined Muslim faithful across the state to allow the lessons of the Eid – El – Kabir have a meaningful impact on their lives with total submission to the will of Allah. Amosun, who joined thousands of other Muslim faithful in to observe the Eid prayer at the Muslim Prayer ground, Lantoro, Abeokuta, the state capital, also appealed to them to practice those lessons always. He lauded the people of the state for the pervasive religious harmony enjoyed in the state over the years and declared in sober tone that this year’s edition drawn the curtain to his Sallah prayer observance with them since his tenure would be rounding up by 29th May, 2019. The governor was joined by the state Commissioner of Police, Ahmed Iliyasu, Chief Medical Director (CMD) of Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Abeokuta, Professor Adewale Musa, former Secretary to the state government and ex – Mines and Steel Minister, Alh. Tunji Sarafa among other dignitaries to observe the Sallah prayer. He reiterated his administration’s resolve to keep working till the hand over date in order to further develop the state and make it investors’ destination of choice. In what appeared as a valedictory Sallah message and brief address to the Muslim community in the state shortly after the prayer session conducted by the Chief Imam of Egbaland, Alhaji Liadi Ogunsolu, Amosun expressed the optimism that he would not return to the Lantoro prayer ground in his “capacity as a governor,” but as someone accompanying his successor to observe the 2019 Eid -El – Kabir prayer’’. The governor’s comment has however, elicited suspicion among many worshippers who wondered whether Amosun was vaguely hinting of plan to install a Muslim as a successor from among dozens of aspirants on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) jostling to succeed him.
