Kogi State Governor’s spokesman, Kingsley Fanwo has expressed confidence in the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Isah Haruna to clinch victory in the bye election to fill the vacant House of Representatives seat for Kogi/Lokoja Federal Constituency. Addressing newsmen in Abuja, Thursday, Fanwo said the People’s Democratic Party stands no chance in the bye election, saying the ruling APC is better positioned than the one that won the 2015 general elections in the state. “I was told their leaders are campaigning in the Federal Constituency. But our party, the All Progressives Congress went from House to House to campaign hard for this election. “I am happy nobody molested the former Governors when they were campaigning for their PDP. It shows that our people listened to our plea to avoid any form of violence before, during and after the elections. But we are prepared to show them a glimpse of how 2019 will look like. “When they were Governors, nobody dared campaign against their party because of the reign of terror. Today, Kogi is different and the electorate will speak with their voter’s cards”. Fanwo said the security agencies in the state has promised a peaceful environment which will guarantee a free, fair and credible poll on Saturday, calling on the citizens to remember Kogi State has zero tolerance for violence.
