The national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Chief Uche Secondus yesterday held a closed door meeting with former Military President General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida. The meeting which took place at the IBB’s hill top house started at about 3:15 pm at the inner chamber of the house devoid of the usual crowd around the house. Sources hinted that Secondus was accompanied by Alhaji Bello Abdulkadir, the former secretary of the Ciroma Committee set up by Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) to ensure the emergence of a northern consensus candidate from among General Ibrahim Babangida, General Aliyu Gusau, and Atiku Abubakar in 2011. The details of the meeting was not made known as journalists were not allowed in but it was gathered that the meeting was necessitated by the growing numbers of presidential aspirants in the PDP. It was learnt that the party is worried that if the retinue of presidential aspirants were allowed to contest it could cause serious problems that may wreck the chances of the party in 2019 general elections. According to the source “ the chairman might have come to seek advice on how to ensure peaceful primaries or consensus formula that will bring out acceptable presidential candidate for the party.” The PDP national chairman stayed for about two hours before leaving the residence of the former Military President.
