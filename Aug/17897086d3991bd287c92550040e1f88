Turning off Location History on an Android smartphone doesn’t prevent Google from knowing where you’ve been. Such data is collected in several other ways – for example, when someone uses Google Maps. To fully turn off the collection of location data, you need to log into your Google account and then navigate to “Web & App Activity” under Activity controls. There you have the option to turn off data collection. This can be done via the Google app on an Android smartphone or by using the browser on a computer. According to Google, when Web & App Activity is turned on, a user’s searches and activity from other Google services are saved to their account in the interests of “better search results and suggestions.” Users can see and delete their searches and browsing activity by visiting “My Activity” while logged into their Google account.
