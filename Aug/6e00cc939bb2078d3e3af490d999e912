Ghanaian President, Nana Akufo-Addo, Friday, announced that the late former Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, will be given state burial in Ghana, September 13. The announcement is sequel to President Akufo-Addo’s meeting with Annan’s family. Annan, a Ghanaian national and Nobel peace laureate, died on Saturday at the age of 80, after a short illness. He was the first black African to lead the United Nations. He served as Secretary-General at a time when worries about the Cold War were replaced by threats of global terrorism, and his efforts to combat those threats and secure a more peaceful world brought him the Nobel Peace Prize. Annan, who was born in Ghana in 1938, served as the seventh UN Secretary-General from 1997 to 2006, and was the first to rise from within the ranks of the United Nations staff. He had also been a member, since 2007, of The Elders, a humanitarian group of a dozen leaders and activists of worldwide stature formed by Nelson Mandela. In 2013, Annan became its chairman.
