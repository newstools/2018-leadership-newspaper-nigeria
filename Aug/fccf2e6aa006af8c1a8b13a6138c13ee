The 45-year-old surgeon, who was licensed to practice in Brasilia and the nearby state of Goiás but not in Rio, was arrested in July at the popular elite resort of Barra da Tijuca, where he performed a buttock-enhancing treatment on bank staffer Lilian Calixto, who died hours later in a private hospital. Prosecutors issued a statement, where they specified that Furtado, essentially assisted by the other persons, had injected 300 ml of Poly (methyl methacrylate), or PMMA, a synthetic resin also known as acrylic glass filler into Calixto’s buttocks), thereby exceeding the recommended quantity. The Brazilian Plastic Surgery Society had earlier warned him against using it at all, yet he continued posting scores of promo-pictures, namely “before” and “after” snapshots of his aesthetic procedures. According to prosecutors, the use of PMMA entailed a “prohibited risk” because the treatment was conducted in the doctor’s apartment that was at best “precariously adapted” to treating patients, in light of the risk of death of the victim.” Furtado and his mother, Maria Fatima Barros, were on the run for five days following the incident, seeking a judicial order the remain free but were subsequently rejected by a Rio court and taken into custody, with Furtado going on to post claims of innocence on social media, attracting a plethora of comments from his followers. Many wrote heartfelt words of support, claiming those who had accused the doctor are mere “opportunists” striving for a brief bout of fame.
