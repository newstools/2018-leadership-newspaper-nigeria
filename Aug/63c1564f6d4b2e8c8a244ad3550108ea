The Northern Leaders and Stakeholders Assembly (NLSA) has urged the leadership of the National Assembly to urgently reconvene and summon the executive to explain the siege by Department of State Services (DSS) at their premises Tuesday. The northern leaders while condemning the incident which it described as a brazen, added that federal legislature should apply disciplinary actions where necessary after A statement signed by secretary of NLSA, Dr. Umar Ardo, said they watched with awe as the democratic values of Nigeria were trampled upon by the security agencies under the All Progressives Congress (APC) federal government. The statement added “The attempt to unlawfully open the Senate Chambers by the siege on the National Assembly this morning for whatever reason in a gestapo-like manner by the Nigerian security forces is perhaps the worst form of impunity our country has witnessed in recent history. This destructive act against our democracy can only be surpassed by a full blown military coup de’tat. “Nigeria’s Democracy was restored and nurtured since 1999 on the sweat and blood of patriots after it was toppled by General Buhari himself in 1983. Nigerians cannot therefore seat back and watch all that have been built for nearly two decades destroyed again by headless power mongers on account of their insatiable selfish interests. “NLSA condemns this act in its totality and calls upon the NASS leadership to as a matter of urgency reconvene the Assembly and summon the leadership of the executive to explain this brazen act by the security services, and apply disciplinary actions where necessary as provided for by the constitution.” They however called Nigerians, especially “Northerners, to stand up against this tyranny and condemn it without reservation and defend our democracy and our constitution.”
