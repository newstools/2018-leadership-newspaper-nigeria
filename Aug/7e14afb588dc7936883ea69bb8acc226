The Nigerian Christian Pilgrims Commission (NCPC) has said it would explore the possibility of extending the scope of pilgrimage operations from Israel, Rome and Greece to holy sites within the country. The executive secretary, NCPC, Rev Tor Uja who made this known when he received the executive members of the Association of Virtuous Women in Pilgrimage and Tourism in Nigeria (AVWOPAT), led by the founder and CEO, Lady Chy Schwimmer, said one of the commission’s mission is to create awareness on Nigerian holy sites and make it available to foreign pilgrims to pray and explore.
He explained that the commission intends to start creating the awareness on holy sites locations in Nigeria during pilgrimage exercise to Israel, Rome and Greece.
He added that NCPC is working on the programme of training tour guards or ground handlers in preparation for the effective management of foreign pilgrims to the sites.
“We believe the project should be ready in the next one year and one of our goals is to make foreign pilgrims explore holy sites in the country and promote business relationships,” he said.
Uja averred that “Pilgrimage is something noble and as such every willing Christian should have the opportunity to participate at-least once in a life time to pray for the progress of family and nation.”
Earlier, Mrs Schwimmer noted that part of the reasons for their visit was to seek partnership with NCPC, and visit Israel to pray and create awareness on Nigeria’s holy sites.
She added that the visit was not just for pilgrimage alone but to see how they could partner with the commission and government in closing the widening gap and disparity between men and women who are into entrepreneurship and service delivery.
