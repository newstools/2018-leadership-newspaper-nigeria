The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has declared a three-day prayer over what it described as a threat to democracy in the country. A statement made available to LEADERSHIP signed by the acting general secretary, CAN, Daramola Bade, yesterday directed churches nationwide to mobilise their members for the prayer from August 27-29 to seek God’s face concerning the social and political state of the nation and for the peaceful conduct of 2019 elections. Bade said that the decision was informed by the “recent political drama unfolding in our nation.” The acting general secretary in the statement asked Christian faithful to pray against the election of evil politicians in 2019. He also urged Christians to pray for peaceful co-existence and an end to bloodshed and violence across the nation. It also admonished Christians to pray for “unity and mutual respect for each other within the three arms of the government.” The statement reads in part, “Following the recent political drama unfolding in our nation that is becoming really embarrassing and constituting big threats to our nascent democracy, the leadership of the CAN has called for a three-day prayer to be observed in all churches in Nigeria for divine protection for our nation and democracy. “We are to pray for economic prosperity of the nation and deliberate effort of the government towards providing gainful employment for the teeming population of unemployed youths in Nigeria. “For the Church’s victory over the forces of darkness that are working against the wellbeing of the Church in Nigeria and for the unity of the Church and that those causing destabilisation would repent from their evils and pursue unity or risk divine judgment.” Bade also asked the churches to pray for divine direction for the political leaders and for the release of Boko Haram captives, including Leah Sharibu and the remaining Chibok girls.
