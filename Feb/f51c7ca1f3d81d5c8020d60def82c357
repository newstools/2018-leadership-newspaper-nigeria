Due to the political uncertainties and quagmire that exist between Governor Nasiru Ahmed Elrufa’i and some notable stakeholders and elected politicians under the banner of All Progressive Congress in Kaduna State, a ranking member of the party in Likoro Alhaji Dan’azumi Mai Lambu has called on the warring functions to trade with caution not to jeopardize the existing goodwill of the party and truncate the dividend and gains of APC during the two years reign of President Muhammadu Buhari. He reiterated that the federal government has achieved a lot and is making progress on both security and economic fronts. It is in view of this development that he further appeal to former Speaker Kaduna State House of Assembly, Alhaji Aminu Abdulfatah to please present himself for election into the office of Kaduna State Governor as this will be the only solution to the near unending political skirmishes that exists within the party not only at State but Local Government levels. He further believes that the wealth of experience, political maturity and decorum exhibited by the former Speaker is second to none as this will translate into both human, social and security development of the State. In a related development he call on the leadership and stakeholders of the APC in Kaduna State to lend their listening ears and give every moral and financial support to the cause of making sure that People of questionable character were never allowed to run the affairs of this party or vie for any elective office. “Aminu Abdulfatah has the capacity to unite APC and even win the hearts of some members of opposition parties to join APC in kaduna state,” said Likoro.
