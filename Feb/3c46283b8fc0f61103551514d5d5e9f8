The All Progressives Congress (APC) has decided to wade into the lingering crisis of the kaduna chapter of the party even as it set up a three-man fact-finding committee headed by the Deputy National Chairman (South), Engr. Segun Oni. The party also affirmed that Alhaji Haddy Ametuo remains the party’s Chairman in its Kogi chapter “until the appropriate organ of the party decides otherwise in accordance with the party’s constitution”. Arising from its executive session, the party’s NWC tasked the parties involved in the Kaduna impasse to “maintain uttermost decorum” as the committee identifies the remote and immediate cause of the disagreement between the parties involved. In a terse statement as signed by the APC national secretary, Mallam Bolaji Abdullahi, it said: “That the unfolding situation in Kaduna State is deeply regrettable and request all parties in the disagreement to maintain utmost decorum and give opportunity for true reconciliation. Consequently, the NWC has set up a three-man committee led by the Deputy National Chairman (South), Engr. Segun Oni to embark on a fact-finding mission to Kaduna State with a view to identifying the remote and immediate causes of the disagreement and the circumstance that led to the demolition of the house of Senator Hunkuyi. The committee is to report back to the NWC within a week. Other members of the Committee are the National Auditor, Chief George Moghalu and National Woman Leader, Hajia Rahmatu Alliyu. ” In respect of Kogi State, the NWC reaffirms that that Alhaji Haddy Ametuo remains the Chairman of the APC in the state until the appropriate organ of the party decides otherwise in accordance with the party’s constitution.”
