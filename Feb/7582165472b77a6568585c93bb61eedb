R&B singer and loverman, Banky W has announced a major change in his business outfit, Empire Mates Entertainment EME. According to the EME co-founder, the EME Company will now be involved in marketing, advertising, public relations, branding and shooting of TV commercials and documentaries. Banky W stated via his social media account that the record label arm of EME was dissolved since January 2017 as a result of a redirection in EME. Banky W added, â€œAfter 9 years of discovering and boosting the careers of many artistes in the music industry, it became necessary to shut down the record label. EME business venture takes a new direction and will now be marketing, advertising, public relations, branding, shooting of TV commercials and documentaries. We are now a full-fledged media agency that focuses on creative marketing, advertising, PR, brand events/activations and a talent management firm. The switch in focus has been amazing and fulfilling. Behind the scenes, we have been able to launch and market a number of brands and companies the way we did artistes but even in the talent management side, we are no longer restricted with working with music artistes. We still work with musicians but we also work with OAPs, actors and will venture into sports management as well.
