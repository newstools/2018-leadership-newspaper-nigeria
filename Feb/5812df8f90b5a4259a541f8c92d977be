President Muhammadu Buhari has asked governors on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to give him time to decide on whether or not he would seek reelection in 2019. This was disclosed by the chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum and Imo State governor, Rochas Okorocha after a meeting with President Buhari at the presidential villa last night. According to him, It is the desire of the governors that  Buhari seeks reelection to consolidate on his performance. He said,  “We discussed so many issues that affect the nations, our party and president’s ambition to run for 2019 election. “It is the desire of the governors that Mr President runs for this exalted office given his performance in the last two years.  We believe that if he continues Nigeria will be better for it. “Anyhow, Mr President in his usual manner, has requested that we give him time and that he will address the nation and the cacaus of the party very soon. So we should be full of expectations that Mr President will make his intention to Nigerians officially. But we hope that his response will be in line with what the governors are thinking. ”Recall that APC governors and some cabinet members have endorsed Buhari for a second term in 2019. Former presidents Olusegun Obasanjo and Ibrahim Babangida have called on President Buhari not to seek for reelection.
