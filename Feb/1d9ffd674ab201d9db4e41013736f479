Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom has raised fresh concern over the herdsmen attacks as well as the influx of over one million cattle into state, after the launch of Operation Ayem Akpatuma, a military exercise in Benue. Governor Samuel Ortom who made this known at the grave site of 73 victims of Fulani herdsmen attack victims buried on January 11, 2018 in Makurdi where he took Senior Pastor of Dunamis International Gospel Centre, Dr Pastor Paul Enenche, and his wife, Dr Pastor Becky, said, over 3 persons were killed even with the presence of the military operations in the state. The Governor appealed to the military to flush out the invaders so that the over 160,000 displaced people who were in eight camps could return to their homes. “More than 60 people have been killed since the mass burial with three of the victims killed last week in Guma local government area by the herdsmen. In a remark, Dr Pastor Enenche who anointed the land as a symbol to signify the breaking of its yoke, declared that the burial would also connote the internment of government and security failure, impunity, Jihadist agenda and all forms of evil in the country. He prayed for God’s justice and judgment against the killers and their sponsors throughout the country and charged the earth to rise up against them.
