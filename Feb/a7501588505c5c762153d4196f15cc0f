The Federal Executive Council (FEC) has approved the request of about N2.2 billion by the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCDA) for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the Bill Clinton Airport Drive. Also, the council approved another sum of N273 million for the provision of field materials for the delivery of quality potable water for residents of the Federal capital territory (FCT). Bill Clinton Drive is the road directly linking the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport Road with the Umaru Musa Yar’Adua Expressway, which is a major national and international gateway to nation’s capital. Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, who disclosed this to newsmen at the weekend, noted that the road, which was constructed in the early eighties, has since exceeded its lifespan of 20 years and is currently in serious need of rehabilitation. Belo explained that the scope of work on the road includes removal of existing bitumen and pavements as well as carrying out asphalting, resurfacing, shoulder dressing and provision of surface water drainage, among others. It could be recalled that the Bill Clinton Drive rehabilitation project is coming on the heels of the recent conclusion of works on the Bill Clinton Interchange and bridge last year. A statement signed by the chief press secretary to the minister, Cosmas Uzodinma, which was made available to LEADERSHIP yesterday, maintained that the administration was mindful that the provision of steady and uninterrupted potable water to residents of the FCT is very necessary to meet WHO standards as well as the Nigerian Drinking Water Quality Standards.
