Transactions on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) ended on a cautious note on Wednesday with the All-Share Index increasing marginally by 0.02 per cent. The index rose by 9.92 points or 0.02 per cent to close at 42,158.32 compared with 42,148.40 achieved on Tuesday due to marginal price growth by blue chips. Also, market capitalisation which opened at N15.125 trillion grew by N4 billion or 0.03 per cent to close at N15.129 trillion. Mr Ambrose Omordion, the Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Ltd. , attributed the mixed performance being experienced in the market to investors adjustment to over 15 per cent growth posted in January. Omordion said that the nation’s stock market for over 10 years never witnessed a growth in January, noting that 2018 January performance was historic. He added that investors’ reactions to Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) directive that banks with over 10 per cent non-performing loans should not pay dividends contributed to the development. He said investors overreacted to the pronouncement meant to safeguard the banks for future growth. He, however, said the market would rebound with improved 2017 earnings being expected in the next couple of days.
