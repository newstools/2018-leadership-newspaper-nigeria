A secondary school teacher, Chiadikobi Ezeibekwe, has married his 17-year-old biological sister in Ekwulobia, Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra State. According to report, Ezeibekwe claimed that he had a revelation where God told him to marry his sibling. He further quoted Bible passages in Deuteronomy to illustrate that siblings could marry each other. The wedding was conducted by Chiadikobi’s elder brother, Chijioke Ezeibekwe, who is the priest of Dwelling Fullness of God Church, Agba, Ekwulobia. “One advantage of doing this is that it discourages divorce. It also retains family values and norms. I don’t feel guilty. I don ’t feel ashamed. I don ’t feel intimidated in any way. Only God can stop us,” he said. It was, however, confirmed that the youth of the village had set ablaze the church, Dwelling Fullness of God Church, where the wedding took place. Confirming the incident, the traditional ruler of Ekwulobia, Chief Gabriel Ezeukwu, said, “Agba village youths, who saw the marriage as an abomination, set ablaze the church where the wedding took place. “I restrained them from further action against the man and his family. If it were in the past, the entire family would be burnt down because this is a grave abomination and sin.” In his reaction, the eldest son of the family, Emeka Ezeibekwe vowed to resist their union. “It ’s over my dead body that they will call themselves husband and wife. It can’t happen,” he said. The Anambra State Police Public Relations Officer, Nkeiruka Nwide, told the newspaper that she heard the story “unofficially.”
