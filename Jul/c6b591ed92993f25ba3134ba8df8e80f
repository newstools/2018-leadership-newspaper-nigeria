The Chief of Staff (COS) to the Senate President, Dr Abubakar Bukola Saraki and Chieftain of the ruling All Progresive Congress (APC) Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed has announced his resignation from the party going forward. Dr. Baba-Ahmed who until his resignation from the APC served as the pioneer State Chairman of the party in Kaduna state and also served as Chairman of the defunct Congress for Progresive Change(CPC) in the state. Addressing a press conference in Kaduna Monday, Dr. Baba-Ahmed said he has sent a formal letter of his resignation to the Chairman of his ward. Given reasons for his resignation, he said, ” this has been a very difficult decision to leave a party I helped form and made my humble contributions to put in power. “After three years however, I need to say that the APC has grossly under-performed , and has forfeited any claim to my loyalty and continued membership. I do not believe in all conscience, that it should be trusted and encouraged to continue to govern our great country beyond 2019. ” I am not leaving to join another party, I will remain in active politics, as this is the main avenue for salvaging our nation from rising insecurity, poverty and bitter divisions. ” This is my decision and mine alone. It has nothing to do with the President of the Senate, Dr Abubakar Bukola Sarki. Itbis a decision taken after due consultations with the AKIDA group, a group thatnhas predated my appointment as chief of staff to the President of the Senate”. It would be recalled that only but recently, a 2015 governorship aspirant on the APC platform, Alhaji Isah Ashiru Kudan and another chieftain of the party also dumped the APC.
