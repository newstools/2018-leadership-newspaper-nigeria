Members of the new Peoples Democratic Party (nPDP) bloc in the All Progressives Congress (APC) will make known their positions regarding their relationship with the ruling party this week. Leader of the group, Alhaji Abubakar Kawu Baraje, made this known in a statement by his media office in Ilorin, Kwara State, yesterday. Among members of the group are Senate President Bukola Saraki, Speaker House of Representatives Yakubu Dogara, and Sokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal. Baraje disclosed that before the end of this week, members of the group would have concluded their consultations and come out with their position on the issues concerning the group. He gave assurance that whatever decision they would take would be one that would seek to promote the wellbeing of the Nigerian masses. He stressed that the corporate interest of the citizenry and a united Nigeria where no man is oppressed is paramount and very dear to their hearts. Baraje thanked Nigerians who have always seen reason for their struggle, particularly the media for adequately reporting their activities.
