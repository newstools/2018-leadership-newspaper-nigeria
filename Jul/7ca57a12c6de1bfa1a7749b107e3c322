The Senate, for the first time yesterday, introduced a bill to enable the creation of State Police with a view to ending the growing spate of killings in the country. The alteration bill titled, “Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (Alteration) Bill, 2018 (SB. 694)”, is being sponsored by deputy Senate president, Ike Ekweremadu (Enugu West) and 75 other Senators. The bill, which passed first reading yesterday, is seeking an amendment to the 1999 Constitution (as amended) to accommodate state and community policing. The National Assembly had recently argued that the gruesome killings and general insecurity in the country can only be abated if state and community policing is established. Precisely on July 4, 2018, the Senate had mandated its Constitution Review Committee to employ proactive legislative proceedings to commence amendment of the 1999 Constitution to allow for the creation of State Police. Both the Senate and House of Representatives have assured of amendment of the constitution, saying if achieved will enhance stable security in the country. Yesterday, the legislative action was perfected and the bill to amend the constitution to enable the establishment of state police was read for the first time. Presiding over plenary, Ekweremadu yesterday stated that it is hopeful that the bill will be read for the second time and finally be reached for public hearing, as soon as possible.
