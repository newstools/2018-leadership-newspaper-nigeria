A man identified as Michael Kayode Bamisaye, has allegedly committed suicide in Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital. Bamisaye, said to be the Director of Finance at the Ise/Orun local government secretariat took his own life yesterday at his residence. The deceased jumped into the well in his compound behind Tinuola Maximum School, off Afao Road and died immediately. Though the cause of his action could not be immediately ascertained, late Bamisaye, according to a source had earlier swallowed cement mixed with water and later jumped into the well in a bid to quicken his own death. According to the source, “The deceased woke up at about 4.00 am to assist his wife to do some house chores and even called some council workers he used to convey to Ise everyday to be ready to join him to their station. “All of a sudden, he disappeared and went outside with the wife looking for her. Later she discovered that the well was opened and they saw the body floating. “The wife and other people who joined her searching later saw the cement he had mixed with water which he might have taken before taking the plunge into the well. “The men of the State Fire Service had come to remove the corpse which has since been deposited at the mortuary.” The police public relations officer (PPRO) Mr Caleb Ikechukwu, could not be reached for his comment on the incident, as his phone was switched off.
