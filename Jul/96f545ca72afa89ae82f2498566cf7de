The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) will soon commence movement of cement for Dangote Cement Company as well as fuel from Lagos to Dagbolu in Osun State. Although the exact date for commencement of the movement of cement could not be ascertained, managing director of the corporation, Engr. Fidet Okhiria , who dropped this in an interview recently in Lagos said that discussions with Dangote Cement Company have reached advance stage. He also disclosed that the corporation would by end of this month commence movement of fuel from Lagos to Dagbolu in Osun State. According to him, by the time the two agreements for evacuation of cement and fuel respectively come to fruition, it would reduce the number of trucks at the Apapa port axis and by extension enhance lifespan of the nation’s roads. Okhiria stated that the corporation has placed order for spare parts for the locomotive engines currently in the corporation’s fleet adding that as soon as the spare parts arrived, some of the broken down locomotive engines in the corporation would  be revived. He expressed optimism that with the liberalisation of NRC and coming on board of General Electric later this year, more engines and wagons would soon be imported from South Africa so as to boost operations of the corporation. On the Lagos to Ibadan and Itakpe to Warri standard gauge railway lines, the managing director said the former was on course while test run of the later would commence this week.
