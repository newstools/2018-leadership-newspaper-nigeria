…Saraki, Dogara send advance team to PDP Although, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) still maintain its majority position in the two chambers of the National Assembly, the gale of defection witnessed by the parliament yesterday may eventually alter the power equation. According to sources, more lawmakers had plan to defect, in a planned mass cross-carpeting which was scheduled to begin on Thursday. But the fear of security harassment and arrest of presiding officers of the National Assembly forced the aggrieved members to announce  their political affiliation. This is also responsible for the  abrupt adjournment of the two chambers till September. It is expected that by the time the parliament reconvene in , more lawmakers who would lose party primaries to preference candidates of the various state governors are likely to join the list of defected lawmakers, as a way of political survival. Nevertheless, the ruling APC still has an opportunity to woo more lawmakers from other minority parties into their fold. This is just as a possible reconciliation could attract those who defected to the ADC, particularly from Oyo state. If this window of opportunity is effectively explored, and ruling APC takes advantage of these low hanging fruits, the party will retain its may position. But if the APC leadership further mismanage the already bad situation the party may eventually record a twist of fate and become a minority party to the PDP. This however may not change the leadership structure in both the Senate and the House, as the presiding officers already have sympathy from lawmakers across the divides. Irrespective of however the pendulum swings, it is just a question of time, the Senate President Dr. Bukola Saraki , Speaker, Yakubu Dogara and Deputy Speaker, Yussuff Lasun Sulaimon will eventually join their advanced team in the PDP and leadership of the National Assembly will formally form an opposition to the current administration.
