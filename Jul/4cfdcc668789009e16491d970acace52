He specifically thanked the Kwara APC members for their “unwavering commitment” to ensuring that the party emerged stronger than ever in the state. “That commitment has been reflected in the overwhelming support and solidarity that we have received, not just from our party members but also from other parties and stakeholders across the state since the melodrama at the National Assembly on Tuesday. “In particular, there has been an expression of overwhelming love and support for Buhari from across Kwara in the wake of the defections by federal legislators from Kwara,’’ he said. The minister also called on the party supporters to remain calm. According to him, “I call on all our members and supporters in Kwara to remain calm, because there is no cause for alarm. “We are presently consulting with the national leadership of our great party, with a view to coming up with a programme of action that will take into consideration the recent developments.’’ Mohammed assured the members and supporters that whatever decision taken after the consultations would be in their overall best interest. ‘’Our members and supporters should have no doubt whatsoever that whatever decisions we take after the consultations will be in their overall best interest,’’ he added.
