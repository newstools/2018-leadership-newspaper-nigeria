Apparently disturbed by the plight of commuters on the Abuja-Nyanya expressway, the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has again declared its determination to complete the ongoing Apo-Wasa-Karshi Road. The administration specifically reiterated that it is resolute in permanently tackling the perennial traffic congestion commuters suffer daily on the Nyanya axis. Coordinator of Satellite Towns Development Department (STDD), Isiyaku Tanko Yamawo, who disclosed this at the weekend, added that the FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello has given the department a marching order to complete the Apo-Wasa-Karshi road, without further delay. “A very essential portion of the road, connecting Apo and Wasa, which was not initially conceptualized in the project, has now been awarded by the current administration and work is on. Without this portion of the road, it was actually a road terminating somewhere in the bush without access to the city.” He stated that everything has been resolved, adding that the contractor is back on site and would ensure that the project is completed in line with the timing of the minister, who believes that the road would provide immediate relief on Abuja-Nyanya axis. The STDD coordinator also revealed that the Federal Executive Council (FEC) has approved about N2 billion for the Wasa resettlement scheme, adding that the contractor has been mobilized to site and preliminary work has began. Yamawo assured that just as the Gbagalape Road is a success story today, so would the Apo-Wasa-Karshi Road and others. He therefore called on FCT residents and commuters to exercise more patience with the administration on the conditions of some roads, especially those linking satellite towns and city centres.
