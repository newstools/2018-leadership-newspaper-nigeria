The Nigeria Police Force has launched a manhunt for suspected killers of seven of its men in Galadimawa roundabout, Abuja. The policemen, who were stationed at Galadimawa roundabout at about 8:00pm in Abuja, were shot at and seven died instantly while one was wounded. The incident occured on monday night. One of the residents of the area who preferred not to be mentioned said the armed men drove to the roundabout and opened fire on the policemen, while another eyewitness said the policemen stopped the assailants for search before they opened fire on the officers. Force PRO, Jimoh Moshood, while reacting to the killing of the policemen, said it goes a long way to prove that the call for the disbandment of the Special Anti-Robbery Sqaud is not justified, as these armed men are always on the rampage and need effective police like SARS to tackle them. He further explained that investigation into the shooting and killing of the policemen has commenced and that the Police will stop at nothing to ensure that the killers are arrested and prosecuted.
