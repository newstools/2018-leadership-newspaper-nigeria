Jibrl, who is representing Kano South Senatorial District, are to launch a Hausa movie titled ‘Mutum Da Addininsa’ to promote and address issues on religious tolerance and peaceful co-existence among Nigerian communities on July 15, 2018 at Coronation Hall in Kano city. This was made public this week by chairman of Chali Enterprises, Alhaji Salisu Aliyu Chali, who sponsors Mutum Da Addininsa. He said, “It is the grandest occasion ever happened in Kannywood (Hausa movie industry). The main reason why these respected leaders embrace the idea of ‘Mutum Da Addininsa’ is their willingness to end religious crisis in some part of the country, which has led to loss of many lives. It also discussses the issue of street begging (Almajiris), especially in the Northern part of the country. “His Royal Highness Emir of Kano Malam Muhammadu Sanusi II will grace the event as the Father of the Day. His Excellency Governor Ganduje is the Chief Host at the event, while Senator Saraki is the Guest of Honor and Senator Barau will be the Chief Launcher of the day. Many religious leaders specifically from Muslim and Christian communities will speak at the event.” Chali also explains that Senator Saraki spent about 36 million Naira to sponsor ‘Mutum Da Addininsa’, which was shot in many states in the country, including Lagos, Edo, Niger, Kano, Plateau, Kaduna States and Federal Capital Territory Abuja. The movie featured many popular Kannywood (Hausa Film Industry) star actors like King Ali Nuhu, Veteran Tijjani Faraga and an upcoming actress Maryam Habila.
