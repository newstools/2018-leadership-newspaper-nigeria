Lawal, who spoke yesterday with newsmen shortly after a stakeholders meeting in Yola, the state capital, explained that the leader of the R-APC, Buba Galadima, is speaking in his person interest, with zero substances to make negative impact in the party. He noted that the leader and his co-travelers resisted the merger of the party at the initial stage  and subsequently  resulted into negative attack against the  ideals of the party on media. “Galadima can talk, most especially with zero substances, leading to the lost of elections of the party in the past. “He and his co-travelers in the party became disgruntled, after they resisted the merger of the party and went on media attack against the person of Mr. President. “President Buhari sidelined them, having realized that, the type of leadership they offer could have no chances of winning the elections. “New people took over the leadership of the party and we successfully won the elections. “The party under the leadership of Adams would ensure everybody’s entitlements is given to him, because he is a unionist, he would do well for the party. The former SGF urged, the NWC of the party, to hasten the inauguration of committee for reconciliation in the party to addres internal crisis in the party. He reiterated that, they would remain bonafide members of the  party at all times.
