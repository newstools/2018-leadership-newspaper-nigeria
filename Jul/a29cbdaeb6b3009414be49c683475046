Benue State governor, Dr Samuel Ortom, may defect from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) today during its emergency National Executive Committee meeting. Recall that Governor Ortom had claimed that the state APC leader, Senator George Akume, gave him red card ahead of the 2019 governorship primary election. Though, the APC national chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomole, intervened, it appears that Ortom has already made up his mind to dump the APC to seek governorship ticket elsewhere. LEADERSHIP learnt that part of the emergency NEC meeting of the PDP today is to receive or deliberate on the possible defection of Governor Ortom and other APC bigwigs into its fold any moment from now.
