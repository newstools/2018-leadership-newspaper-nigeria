Katsina State governor, Aminu Bello Masari yesterday berated governors of the Northwest states for refusing to attend a meeting on the security of the zone held in Kaduna. Masari who is chairman of the security committee inaugurated by the Northern Governors’ Forum said the governors must separate politics with the issue of security that affects the generality of the people. The meeting attended by the deputy governors of Sokoto and Kaduna States also had in attendance secretaries to the state governments of the two states and that of Katsina, as well as various consultants on security. The meeting also discussed regional integration and economic cooperation among the seven states in the North West. “The issue of security is more important than politics as it affects life,” Masari said at the opening of the meeting, which later went into closed-door session. He noted that it is important to evolve ways of sustaining attendance, not only by the governors, but also their deputies and SSGs. The governor added: “It will not however hinder the discussions or delay the meeting we must devise means of continuing with the meeting even when the governors are not in attendance. “Before we leave, we should have a programme that we can brief our governors. We should not allow this laudable initiative rely only on the availability of governors.” LEADERSHIP Sunday gathered that most of the governors were absent due to official engagements. The Governor of Kebbi State, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu who was said to be currently in Ekiti State as the chairman of APC committee on the July 14 governorship election in the state was however represented at the meeting. The Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal who was represented at the meeting was said to be engaged in a national assignment.
