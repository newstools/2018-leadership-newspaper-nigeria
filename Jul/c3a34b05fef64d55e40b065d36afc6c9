Says It’s A National Call To Action Senator Representing Kano Central Federal Constituency, former Governor of Kano State, (Dr) Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso has been urged to contest for President in the 2019 general election. The call was made by a group known as Kwankwaso Support Initiative (KSI) in a communiqué signed by its Chairman, Abdullahi Dahiru Esq and Secretary, Franklin Onyeneke, made available to journalists in Abuja. The statement says, “A<img class="size-medium wp-image-69491 alignleft" src="https://i2.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Page-4-First-story-Kwankwaso.jpg?resize=300%2C281&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="281" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Page-4-First-story-Kwankwaso.jpg?resize=300%2C281&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Page-4-First-story-Kwankwaso.jpg?resize=427%2C400&amp;ssl=1 427w, https://i2.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Page-4-First-story-Kwankwaso.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" />fter deliberation and presentations by participants at the Save the Nigerian State Conference, 2018, held by Kwankwaso Support Initiative (KSI) in Abuja, with focus on the Security, Unity and Economy of the country, we concluded that Senator (Dr.) Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso remain a credible alternative with requisite experience, qualities and capability to resuscitate Nigeria’s failing economy, security and unity. KSI is therefore urging Senator, (Dr) Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso to run for the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, as we assure him of the group’s readiness to massively mobilize Nigerians across board for this important national call to action. The group holds the view that Kwankwaso remains a credible and strong candidate and can give president Buhari the needed challenge necessary for the exalted office of the president of Nigeria. It recalled that Kwankwanso contested the primaries of the All Progressives Congress (APC), against the incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari and the former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar where he came second with about 974 votes in the run up to the 2015 elections. KSI said Kwankwaso’s track record of achievements during his days as the governor of Kano State and as a former Minister of Defence qualifies him as a worthy successor to take Nigeria to the promised land “It becomes imperative for anyone with Nigeria at heart to drum massive support for Kwankwaso’s presidency in 2019,” the group said.
