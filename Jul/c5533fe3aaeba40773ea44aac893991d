The management of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC, yesterday, said it was investigating the controversy surrounding the alleged forged exemption letter by the current minister of Finance, Mrs Kemi Adeosun. According to a press release by NYSC made available to LEADERSHIP by the director, Press and Public Relations, Mrs Adeyemi Adenike which reads in part, “Our attention has been drawn to the issue of the alleged forgery of an NYSC Exemption Certificate by the Honorable Minister of Finance, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun. It also quoted that, “Checking our records, Mrs. Adeosun did apply for an Exemption Certificate”. Recall, the news broke out last week alleging that Mrs Adeosun’s certificate was dated September 9, 2009 and was purportedly signed by Yusuf Bomoi, a former director-general of the corps. It was also alleged that Bomoi stepped down from the NYSC in January 2009 and could not have signed any certificate for the corps eight months after. The retired brigadier general passed on in September 2017. Meanwhile, there are speculations that Adeosun, shunned mandatory national service and went ahead to obtain a forged exemption certificate years later. Commentators are asking the minister to resign as the certificate scandal continued to dominate discussions. Mrs Adeosun graduated from the Polytechnic of East London, renamed University of East London in 1989. She did not return to Nigeria to observe the mandatory year-long service as required for Nigerians who graduate before their 30th birthday. Instead, she secured an exemption certificate.
