One of the fastest growing transportation business in Nigeria , Taxify on Tuesday 26th June, introduced varieties of exotic vehicles to ease passengers comfort as they go on their daily dealings. Taxify COMFORT, will enable riders to have an alternative to the existing Taxify category. The new category is positioned to offer riders more choice in the way they move. COMFORT will also have pre-selected upscale vehicles combined with highly rated driver-partners to offer riders a great experience on their trips. According to Country Manager, Uche Okafor “We want to cater to a broader audience and offer more choice to riders in the way that they move. We’re all about rider choice at Taxify which is why we have introduced the COMFORT Category for the people of Abuja to have more options when they desire to move in style for events such as a business meeting, date night or a night about town.” Taxify has said that the launch of the COMFORT category will be celebrated with a 15% discount on all fares. On the response from the Abuja market, Okafor said “It’s a market that is ready. So far, interest in the new category has been impressive. We already have hundreds of driver-partners signed up to be part of the COMFORT category and are increasingly onboarding new partners everyday. Driver-partners with vehicle models from 2009 till date can sign up on partners.taxify.eu and register to drive on the COMFORT category.“
