A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Olukayode Akindele  has urged the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, to join the 2019 presidential election. Akindele, who spoke with LEADERSHIP Sunday, said the Senate President has the experience, political pedigree and  temperament to hold the position. The PDP chieftain said with the Supreme Court verdict which cleared Saraki of any corruption charge puts him in good stead for the position. He however urged the Senate President to hasten his return to PDP,  where he truly belongs to seek for the top job. Although Saraki hasn’t left his party,  the All Progressives Congress (APC)  his core loyalist, under the Reformed-APC, signed the MoU with PDP and 38 other opposition political parties last Monday. Akindele however said, “I believe Nigeria needs a rounded politician who has a firm grasp of the diversity of Nigeria and also has the requisite experience in government, to emerge president in 2019. “Saraki has all the quality you expect for someone to preside over a country like Nigeria. And in addition he will not be seen as a religious fanatic. He is the most educated and experienced politician so far. “He has served as four years as special adviser to former President Olusegun Obasanjo and he served as governor for eight years as well. He was elected into the Senate in 2011 and today he is the Senate President. With a robust curriculum vitae like that I think he will do well as president of this country.” On the Senate president’s return to PDP,  Akindele said, “Saraki is orginally a PDP man. We know why he and others left, but we thank God that they are returning to the party under which they can fully function to the benefit of all Nigerians. So I urge him to hasten his return because the party, having had some reforms, awaits him.”
