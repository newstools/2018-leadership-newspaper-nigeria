Former Vice President of Nigeria, Atiku Abubakar yesterday called for a stop to what he called brigandage in Ekiti State following the attack on the state governor, Ayo Fayose. Atiku said he was appalled at the images coming out of Ekiti in the last few hours. In a statement from his media office in Abuja, the former vice president said that behaviours such as these are an uncivil assault on democracy and falls short of democratic best practices. The Peoples Democratic Party presidential hopeful reminded that the current administration came into being because the preceding PDP federal government ensured free and fair elections at all levels. “Having been a beneficiary of such propriety, it is incumbent on the federal government not to deprive others of the ladder it was provided by its predecessors. “Free, fair and credible elections are not a privilege. They are a right! The peaceful congregating of the good people of Ekiti State, be they members of the All Progressives Congress or the Peoples Democratic Party or of any other party, must be allowed by the Federal Government”. Atiku observed that it is not in the place of government to harass, intimidate, hound and humiliate political opponents in an election. What government should do is to provide a level playing ground and guarantee the security of the electorate and the principal political actors in the election. The former vice president however admonished the federal government to do everything within its powers to douse the tension being generated over the governorship election in Ekiti State.
