A group of Federal Capital Territory (FCT) indigenes, Abuja Original Inhabitants Youth Empowerment, have called on the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) to extend the ongoing rehabilitation of 10.2 kilometers Abaji-Rubochi road, to Kuje main town. In a statement signed by its president, Commander Isaac David, which was made available to LEADERSHIP yesterday, the group noted that if the road project was extended to Kuje town, it would reduce the traffic congestion along Lokoja-Abuja road. The group however commended the FCT minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, for commencing the rehabilitation of Abaji-Rubochi road, noting that the minister has broken a jinx, for rehabilitating a road, which has been abandoned for over 32 years. “We want to commend you for the commencement of the rehabilitation of the Abaji -Rubochi road, which was last constructed 32 years ago. You have broken a developmental record in the FCT and the indigenes are very happy. We pray that Almighty God gives you the enablement to extend the road to Kuje main town after this first phase, as a testament of your giant strides in the provision of rural infrastructure.” David observed that the road project, when completed would boost the economy of the rural dwellers in both Kuje and Abaji area councils and also ease the movement of goods and services along the corridor. Recall that the Satellite Towns Development Department (STDD) of the FCTA had last week flagged off the rehabilitation of Abaji-Rubochi 10.2 kilometers road at the cost of N490, 000, 000.00.
