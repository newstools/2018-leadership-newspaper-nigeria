The Speaker of the Nasarawa State House of Assembly, Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe Abdullahi, yesterday said that the exit of Mr John Mamman, a retired Permanent Secretary in the state and thousands of his supporters marks the end of Peoples Democractic Party (PDP) in Kokona local government area of the state. Balarabe Abdullahi made this known in Kokona in response to the defection of Mamman, a renowned politician and a longest serving “general of PDP” in Kokona local government area of the state, recently. The Speaker said that with the defection of Mamman from PDP to All Progressives Congress (APC) is a great loss and set back to PDP and a big fish to the ruling APC which would boost the party chances of winning all elective positions in the area and the state at large. “With the defection of Mamman to APC, it marks the end of PDP not only in Kokona local government area of the state but in the Nasarawa West senatorial district at large. “We have been waiting for him to join our party, now that God has touched him to join us, PDP is finished,” he said. According to him, in the forthcoming election, all the 10 members of the State House of Assembly from Nasarawa West will come from APC, House of Representatives members and Senate will also come from APC.
