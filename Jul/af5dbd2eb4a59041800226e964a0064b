Pay television operator, MultiChoice is set to slash subscription price on its digital terrestrial television platform, GOtv, while increasing prices of bouquets on its digital satellite platform, DStv. The price adjustment would take effect on August 1. When it takes effect, sources disclosed, subscribers on the GOtv MAX package would pay N3, 200 instead of N3, 800 currently being charged for the package. The new price regime would see prices on the five DStv bouquets go up slightly. The expected new price for DStv Compact is N500 higher than what customers currently pay, as the price goes up to N6, 800 from N6, 500.  Premium subscribers would pay N15, 800 instead of N14, 700 currently being paid, a difference of N1, 100. Compact Plus subscribers would pay N10, 650 as against N9, 900 currently being paid. Prices of the two lowest DStv packages, Family and Access, are also to be similarly reviewed. Subscription for the Family bouquet would go up to N4,000 from N3,800, while that of the Access package would rise to N2, 000 from N1, 900. The company had not issued an official statement on the expected price adjustments as at the time of filing the report. In a related development, sports broadcaster, SuperSport, would from the start of the 2018/2019 season broadcast live all the 380 matches of the Italian league, popularly known as Serie A. The matches of the league competition, which kicks off on August 19, would be available both DStv and GOtv platforms.  The development is sequel to an agreement reached between SuperSport and the Serie A.
