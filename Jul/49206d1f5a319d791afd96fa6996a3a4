The Bauchi state government has lauded the Supreme Court ruling which set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and upheld the trial Court Judgement in the Supreme Court case( SC:854/2016) between Governor MA Abubakar and Comrade Abdullahi Mohammed Tanko and two others. The court, presided over by Justice Justice Sidi Bage while delivering his judgement on Friday, set aside the judgement of the Court of Appeal and upheld the trial court judgment. A statement signed by the special adviser, Media and Strategy to Bauchi State governor,Ali M Ali said a suit filed by Comrade Abdullahi Mohammed Tanko secured a favorable judgement at the Appeal Court sitting in Jos challenging the December 2014 APC primary election that returned MA Abubakar as the APC gubernatorial flag bearer and subsequent election as governor. The statement noted that the respondent had earlier lost his case in the trial court and thereafter appealed the case at the Appeal Court to upturn the verdict of the court that upheld the election of MA Abubakar as duly elected. It said the “Appellant MA Abubakar, however, appealed to the Supreme Court faulting the entire judgement of the Appeal Court and faulted the verdict on several grounds. “The Judge agreed with the Counsel of the Appellant that the lower court erred on two major fronts and thereby set aside those judgments and upheld the trial court verdict.”
