Kaduna State chairman of the ruling party’s splinter group known as Reformed-All Progressives Congress (R-APC), Col. Dauda Gora (rtd) yesterday unveiled the group’s state and local government executives with a promise for inclusive leadership. Gora who addressed a press conference in Kaduna said, the Reformed All Progressives Congress (R-APC) executives would work with like-minded political parties and platforms to offer good governance to the people in the state come 2019. “We will in concert with others offer real change to Kaduna State; we are done with this fake change which the APC has offered to our party, while we despair, we are yet hopeful that with you (the people) behind us we shall salvage our State and make it truly Great Again. “I wish at this juncture to present to you the State Executive of the Reformed All Progressives Congress.” Gora presented Hajiya Rabi Abdulsalam, former commissioner for Youth and Women Affairs as vice chairman of the R-APC in the state. Recall that Alhaji Buba Galadima on Wednesday in Abuja announced the formation of the group. Galadima said that the ruling party had failed to meet the yearnings of the people who voted them into power in the 2015 general elections.
