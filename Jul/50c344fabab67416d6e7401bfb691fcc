Former Kano state governors and erstwhile political opponents, Rabiu Kwankwaso and Ibrahim Shekarau met Saturday night to ostensibly bury their difference work together in the  Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP), both at the state and national level as the 2019 elections beckons. LEADERSHIP reports that this is the first formal meeting of the former political opponents in 15 years, when Senator Kwankwaso paid a congratulatory visit to  Ibrahim Shekarau for defeating him in the 2003 governorship election. Sources say the brief meeting, took place at Ibrahim Shekarau’s Asokoro residence. Although the two Kano political giants held the meeting in closed-door, reports say  Shekarau was heard saying there was “no hard feelings, and I don’t bear any grudge”, at the end of the meeting. In reply,  Kwankwaso also said he did not bear malice against him, assuring him of his commitment and collaboration towards the success of the party. Following Kwankwaso’s defection to PDP last week, the senator has been extending olive branch to politicians in the PDP towards realigning the party structure at the state level. Reports say that the party leaders at the national level have favoured  Kwankwaso to have 51 percent stake in the party structure, having joined the party alongside nine members of the House of Representatives. “The party leaders know the political weight of the senator. Aside his being a serving senator, he currently has a serving deputy governor, nine serving Reps and six serving members of the House of Assembly in his political kitty. “Essentially, he is the most powerful force in the state today. This is what the party at the national level considered to cede the control to him,” said a source familiar with the equations.
