Elders and party members of the Ogun state Chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC) has kicked against the purported defection of the Senator representing Ogun Central Senatorial District, Dr. Lanre Tejuosho to Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) saying he has betrayed them by such act.  APC in a statement issued and signed by its Publicity Secretary, Wole Elegbede, APC referred to the senator as a betrayal, who “does exactly the opposite under the cover of darkness”. This is just as members of the Ogun Central Senatorial district, the constituency that produced Tejuoso also dissociated themselves from the purported defection of their Senator from the party. In a communique issued Thursday in Abeokuta, the state capital and signed by the Chairman and Secretary, Engineer Yomi Ademefun and Engineer Ariori Saheed respectively, Tejuoso’s senatorial kinsmen said the Senator has never discussed with the Leadership of the party before he took his action. While distancing themselves from the action taken by the Senator, the communique further stated that interactions of the APC leadership with Tejuoso’s coordinators and followers in Ogun Central Senatorial district also indicated that none of them was involved in his action. The communique reads in part, “Much as we concede the rights of Senator Lanre Tejuoso to take any personal decision he deems fit particularly, we that voted for him to become a Senator hereby, distance ourselves from his action. “Ogun APC Central Senatorial district remains one and indivisible and owes its allegiance to the party in the state and the nation as a whole. “We also reiterate our abundant confidence in the APC led state government of our indefatigable governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun and also commend him for the wonderful works done so far in the mission to rebuild Ogun state”.
