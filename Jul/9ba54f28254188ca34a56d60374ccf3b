Ten-year-old Kambinachi Kanu, a final year primary school pupil of Temple Preparatory School, Ilupeju, Lagos, Nigeria, emerged the global winner in the 9-12-year-old category of this year’s annual ‘Girls Who Innovate’ competition, under the theme, ‘The Future of Education.’ The initiative hosted across Middle East and Africa and organised by Ericsson, global telecom equipment maker, aims to support the Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations, especially Goals four and five – Quality Education and Gender Equality respectively. “Ericsson remains committed to advancing and promoting technology innovations in the Middle East and Africa,’’ said Girish Johar, head of Human Resources, Ericsson, Middle East and Africa. “On a global scale, we’re also working towards ensuring that girls interested in pursuing a career in ICT are empowered to overcome discrimination, stereotypes and other gender norms the society might throw at them,’’ he concluded. Kambinachi’s winning idea is the donation of fairly used tablets to children in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps in Nigeria, thus ensuring the continuation of their education in a safe environment. Classroom learning will then be limited to days when security is assured and continuous communication with tutors will take place via an e-learning platform. From the Middle East and Africa, two other entries from the United Arab Emirates (13-15 category) and Ghana (16-18 category) made it to the finals and emerged regional winners. But it was Kambinachi who made it all the way to become the global winner in her category. Ericsson received many enthusiastic entries from young innovators aged 9 to 18, who competed to win Job Shadow Days, an Ericsson blog feature, and a 1,000 EUR star prize. Their entries showcased different ideas on how technology could shape the future of education globally.
