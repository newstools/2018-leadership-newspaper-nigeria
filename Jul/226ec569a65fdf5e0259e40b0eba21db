Following the highly publicised visit of Floyd Money Mayweather to Nigeria and other parts of African countries which LEADERSHIP reported before it was canceled, a Nigerian company has alleged it was screwed out of a fortune by the wealthy American and is now suing to get its money back. A report from TMZ making rounds says  the company behind the lawsuit is Zinni Media, which claims it booked Floyd to make five appearances in Nigeria and Ghana in June 2017 … for the low sum of $375,000!!!! According to the report, the company says it got Floyd to make a video confirming the appearances — so, they thought they were good to go! They even wired him $210,000 in advance. But, days before the first event, Floyd bailed — and the company was left holding the bag. In the suit, Zinni claims Floyd’s reps offered to reschedule for Dec 2017 — and added more appearances to the list — but, he also raised the price to $550,000. Zinni claims they were told they could use the $210k toward the new booking price. Zinni says they accepted the new deal — but, when they asked Floyd to make a new video confirming the new dates, he bailed again … and never returned the original $210,000. Now, Zinni is taking legal action in federal court in California — claiming Floyd damaged their reputation and defrauded them. Zinni wants at least $2million to make things right.
