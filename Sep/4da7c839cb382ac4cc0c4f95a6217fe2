The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Katsina State has been divided over mock primary conducted for seven governorship aspirants of the party.
The electoral panel constituted by the Katsina PDP ahead of its formal primary had last Monday in Katsina declared Senator Yakubu Lado as the PDP governorship consensus candidate based on his performance at the mock poll in which about 80 delegates out of no less than 3,700 official delegates of the branch participated.
Similarly, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Katsina State has been sailing in turbulent waters as President Muhammadu Buhari’s son-in-law, Abubakar Ismaila Isah, is believed to be ready for a tough fight for the APC ticket, while Governor Aminu Bello Masari is being promised the ticket to return to the Muhammadu Buhari Government House Katsina by the Katsina APC stakeholders. Most of the aspirants who allegedly signed an agreement to accept the outcome of the mock primary had vehemently kicked against the exercise. A cousin of late President Umar Musa Yar’adua and one of the governorship hopeful of the PDP, Ahmed Aminu Yar’Adua, has petitioned the national leadership of the party to declare the purported primary unconstitutional and illegal. Similarly, Engr Musa Nashuni, the PDP 2015 governorship candidate, who is seeking to pick the party’s ticket again has disassociated himself from the mock primary that produced Lado as the preferred candidate of PDP for 2019. Denouncing the primary as an exercise in futility, Nashuni lamented that the procedures that they agreed on were not followed in the mock primary even as he assured that he would not leave the party. On his part, Alhaji Umar Abdullahi Tata, one of the top contenders for the PDP ticket, has renounced his membership of the party following the controversial primary although he is yet to make public his next political move ahead of 2019.
