The operatives of Lagos State Police Command on Tuesday arrested a Lagos based lawyer, Mr. Edward Oseghale for procuring false judgement document in a matter involving a tenant and landlord. The lawyer was alleged to have used the judgement obtained in another matter from a different court with the same number but different year for the eviction of a tenant in Lagos. Speaking with journalists in Lagos, Chief Registrar of the Lagos State Judiciary, Mrs. Taiwo Olatokun said Edward Oseghale was arrested in the court premises after making appearance in another matter. The Chief Registrar also said the alleged lawyer has been handed over to the Police for investigation and prosecution. She said the lawyer was arrested in the court of Magistrate T. Abayomi of Court 4, Surulere, Lagos. Olatokun said issue of forgery has been a source of headache to the Lagos judiciary, adding that’’ The ministry has been inundated with inquiries from embassies and foreign missions abroad seeking verification for judgment procured by lawyers, some in issues relating to divorce and that the Chief Justice of Lagos State, Justice Opeyemi Oke is determined to prosecute this matter as a deterrent to others. “It has become a big problem for us. We are taking steps but we decided that as long as we can get hold of the people doing it, the law takes it course hence the CJ is interested in prosecution of this lawyer as a deterrent for those using fake documents. ‘’We have told the Chief Security Officer that this matter must be prosecuted, we have forwarded documents to the police”, she said. According to her, all the staff of the judiciary are ready to give evidence, adding “for us it is a serious and a very painful development, she wants us to prosecute and see to the end of this case”.
