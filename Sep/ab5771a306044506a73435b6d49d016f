 The governing All Progressives Congress (APC) has consensus candidates for elective positions reacted to some state chapters of the party on who have already began the announcement of consensus candidates for elective positions in their respective domains. While calling for due diligence, the APC stated that having a consensus candidate does not therefore foreclose the process of direct or indirect primaries for those vying for elective positions. In a terse release, Ag. National Publicity Secretary of APC, Yekini Nabena, stressed that “while consensus is provided for by the Party’s Constitution, the option is conditional”, adding that the option can only apply where no other aspirant has signified interest through obtaining of forms for the particular position. The statement reads in part: “The attention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has been drawn to announcements of consensus candidates for elective positions in some states. “It is therefore pertinent to make some clarifications to enlighten Party faithful on the procedure for nominating candidates. “Consensus does not foreclose Direct or Indirect Primaries for all elective positions as contained in the resolution of the 6th meeting of the Party’s National Executive Committee (NEC). “Again, consensus will apply when no other aspirant signify interest (i.e. through purchase of nomination forms) for the position in question.
