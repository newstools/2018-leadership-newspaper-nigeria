The Texas police officer who fatally shot a neighbor last week after apparently mistaking his apartment for her own was arrested Sunday and charged with manslaughter, report confirms. Investigators have said that Guyger, 30, shot and killed 26-year-old Botham Jean late Thursday when she returned from work. She said she entered his apartment thinking it was hers, according to authorities. She called the shooting into dispatch moments after it happened. Jean, who worked for PricewaterhouseCoopers and was a native of Saint Lucia, was transported to Baylor University Medical Center where he was pronounced dead. The shooting happened Thursday around 10 p.m. after Guyger worked a full shift and was returning home in her uniform, according to a previous statement from Dallas police. “At some point” after entering Jean’s apartment, she shot him, police have said. The official told the paper that Guyger had mistakenly parked one floor above her own apartment on Thursday night and seemingly did not pick up on the discrepancy of a red doormat in front of Jean’s apartment — which her own residence did not have. She was new to the building, according to the official. Jean left his front door unlocked and the lights inside were also off, the official said. According to this official’s account, Guyger believed that Jean was a burglar and shot twice, striking him once, then called authorities. She was also seen outside the apartment crying while on the phone. She said, “I thought it was my apartment” and “I’m so sorry,” according to the Morning News, citing the official. Dallas Police Chief U. Renee Hall said Friday that the shooting remains under investigation. She acknowledged that “there are more questions than we have answers.”
