The fate of Lagos State governor, Akinwunmi Ambode on his bid for a second term of office hung in the balance as the Governor’s Advisory Council (GAC) deleted the Lagos State All Progressives Congress (APC) ticket brouhaha from its agenda and adjourn its sitting to Saturday. Although they declined to issue a communique or address the press on the outcome of the meeting LEADERSHIP gathered from a very reliable source at the meeting that the issue that dominated discussion at the meeting that started at about 4pm in Bourdilon residence of the national leader of APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu in Lagos was Osun State governorship poll which holds on Saturday. The source said, ‘’ The issue that dominated the meeting was Osun governorship election scheduled for Saturday. Our leader Asiwaju Bola Tinubu came from Osun to the meeting and he is going back to Osun this night because he has a role to play there. ‘’The Issue of Governor Akinwunmi Ambode, Babajide Sanwo-Olu and Obafemi Hamzat was not discussed. We decided to put it on hold till weekend when we will be through with Osun State election. Anybody that tells you that a decision has been reached is lying.’’ The national leader of All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu had scheduled a meeting of the state’s highest advisory political organ, Governor’s Advisory Council (GAC), yesterday in Lagos to discuss Ambode’s political future which has been in a precarious situation since the Mandate Movement, threw up the Managing Director of Lagos State Development and Property Corporation (LSDPC), Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to challenge the governor at the party’s primary. The council, made up of the governor and leaders of the party across the three senatorial districts of the state, with Tinubu as chairman, include, Dr. Olorunfemi Bashorun; Senator Anthony Adefuye, Prof. Tunde Samuel, Chief Adeyemi Ikuforiji, Alhaji Tajudeen Olusi and Cardinal James Odumbaku.
