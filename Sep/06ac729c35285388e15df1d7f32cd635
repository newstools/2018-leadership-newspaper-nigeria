Senator Magnus Abe (Rivers southeast) has stated that it is fair Ogoni people produce the next governor of Rivers State taking into cognisance, issues of equity and justice. He said this because according to him, the people of Ogoni people have not produced a governor in the state since it was created 50 years ago. He also maintained that God’s time is the best. “I think Gods time is always the best time. But looking at the issues in the country at the moment and the feelings of people, there is the need for justice and fair play across the country. I believe that is an issue that the Ogoni people take very seriously; indeed Rivers people, because justice is for everybody,” Senator Abe said. Commenting on his strained relationship with the minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi, the senator said it was purely politics and nothing else. “It’s purely politics and nothing else but I believe that as we move forward, political issues would be addressed,” he said. He also said the people of Ogoni are deeply grateful to President Muhammadu Buhari for all the good things he has done for them. “We are supporting the president because of the things he has done for us and we believe that whatever he can do, he will continue to do. Today our majesty the king, conferred a title on the President. The title he gave the President, ‘Mene Dolenu of Ogoni land’ on President Buhari (meaning the King that does good things for the Ogoni people). So the president is part of us and he has shown that special relationship to the Ogoni people and there is no condition for whatever the president wants form us.”
