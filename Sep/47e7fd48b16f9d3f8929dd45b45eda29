Former national chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and senator representing Benue North East senatorial district, Barnabas Gemade has again defected to Social Democratic Party (SDP). Gemade who  defected from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the PDP a few weeks ago  was said to have moved to SDP where he picked the party form to realise his ambition of returning to the senate again. He is expected to submit the nomination form to his new party (SDP) today. The senator had three weeks ago picked  the expression of intent and nomination forms of PDP but our correspondent gathered from the state party secretariat that Gemade did not return the form. Former publicity secretary of SDP, Philip Wuhe told our correspondent that the senator would be submitting his senatorial form in Abuja on Tuesday. “Gemade will be submitting his nomination and expression of intent forms to the party tomorrow”, he said. Wuhe added that Gemade would be battling with two other aspirants: Senator Joseph Akargerger and Tornger Malu on the platform of SDP for the Zone “A” senatorial seat. Gemade’s legislative aide, Alaga Udu, had a few weeks ago  told our correspondent that Gemade was not planning to  defect from PDP, saying, ‘as am talking to you now, Gemade  has picked  his  form today.’ Reacting to the defection of Gemade, the publicity secretary of PDP in the state, Bemgba Lortyom said that the party was not aware if the senator had left the party. “I’m not aware if Senator Gemade has left the party” because I don’t know if he picked the party’s form because aside the state assembly form which they are buying and submitting  here, other forms are picked from  Abuja”. “Even though the senators were buying forms in Abuja, they were asked to submit their forms to the state but Gemade is yet to submit his form here”, he said.
