Some natives of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), under the platform of Coalition of FCT Indigenous Associations (CFCTIA), have claimed responsibility for last week’s earth tremor that occurred in some parts of Mpape community and Maitama district in the nation’s capital. A statement signed by the spokesman of the group, Yunusa Ahmadu Yusuf, which was made available to LEADERSHIP yesterday, warned residents to expect more of such disturbances in parts of the territory, unless the federal government addresses the injustices and marginalisation against the FCT natives. Yusuf stated that the presidency, especially the Aso Villa should expect an unprecedented earth disturbance, if between now and October, 2018, an indigene of the territory is not appointed as a minister. “Some recent time past, the Abuja Original Inhabitants had threatened to invoke the spirit of their ancestor in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to join us in this genuine struggle to liberate our people from the dungeon of marginalization by the federal government. We have cried enough and we may have to divulge to other alternatives to agitate for our exclusion in the scheme of things. So, the FCT native’s ancestors are responsible for the recent earth disturbance in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).” He described as laughable the claim by some government agencies and officials that the earth disturbance was a natural occurrence, adding that the natives have always maintained peace, with utmost believe in every central administration, but frowned that this peace offer has been neglected and abused. He continued: “It is very regrettable that since our ethnic consensus to allow free government operation in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), the government has not returned back the gesture, but rather have sort different means to squash and alienate us in our ancestral land. Today, we the Abuja Original Inhabitants wish to reiterate categorically that the struggle is not yet over and we will not relent until deliberate efforts by the FG are visibly recorded, which includes the appointment of an FCT native as a Minister.”
