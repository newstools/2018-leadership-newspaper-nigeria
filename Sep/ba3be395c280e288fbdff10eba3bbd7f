A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and 2015 director general of the Buhari Campaign Organisation (BCO) in Kagarko local government of Kaduna State, Hon. Shunom Adinga, has formally dumped the APC and seeking House of Assembly tickect under the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP). Adinga who cited lack of internal democracy and the lack of the dividend of democracy to his local government council by the government of the ruling APC in the state, also averred that the APC has practically lost the good will it enjoyed prior to the 2015 general elections, stressing that remaining there will amount to a major political risk. This is just as he alleged that the “current mandate of the local government chairman of Kagarko on the platform of the APC is a stolen one”. Towards this end, he called on the elected local government chairman to better the lives of the people in the area “he should use the stolen opportunity to do justice to all and sundry regardless of party affiliation”. Speaking during a formal declaration to seek to represent Kagarko local government in the Kaduna State House of Assembly in the 2019 general elections under the flag of the PRP, said, he choice to represent his people is borned out of the passion to give his constituency qualitative representation. “Regardless of the party affiliation, i am offering myself for effective and qualitative representation for the good people of Kagarko local government,” he further said.
