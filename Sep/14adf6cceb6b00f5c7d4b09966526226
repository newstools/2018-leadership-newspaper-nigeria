Former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, has warned the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), that altering votes in the just-concluded Osun State governorship election results will lead to anarchy. Atiku, who is a presidential aspirant for the 2019 general elections under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) issued the warning in a post on his Twitter page. He wrote: “The people of Osun have made their choice. What is required of INEC is to express that decision without any subtraction or addition. “Anything short of that is a threat to democracy and a call to anarchy.” Meanwhile, both local and foreign election observers have described the Osun election as peaceful, free and fair.
