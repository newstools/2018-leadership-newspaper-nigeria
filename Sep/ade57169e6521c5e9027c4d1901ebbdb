Immediate past special adviser to the Benue State Governor on Bureau for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs and governorship aspirant under the platform of the Ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Titus Zam, has said that his decision to join the governorship race was predicated on the poor performance of the incumbent governor which made the APC leadership to give him red card. Zam who stated this at a press conference at his campaign office in Makurdi, lamented that governor Samuel Ortom was a total stranger in APC who did not understood the APC ideologies, manifestoes and programmes which principally accounted for his overall poor performance and lack of knowledge of the change philosophy which APC stands for. He noted that the red card politics which Governor Ortom exploited at his peril was a derivative of an extensive research and consultation with the rank and file of Benue APC which concluded that fielding Ortom in 2019 would be a disaster to the party and was dramatically kicked out. “The Benue people are poorer under Governor Ortom than the two previous administration. The gap between the rich and ordinary man in the state today is wider as the middle class that was systematically created by George Akume and Gabriel Suswam has been deliberately wiped out by Ortom’s administration. “Unemployment in Benue today have reached their zenith and no one cares. As I speak, there is no single window for the employment of Benue graduate as all the openings in both private and public sectors have been shutdown.” The former Adviser promised to reinstate over 10,000 local government workers who were sacked by the Ortom’s administration by Abounu led Committee, if elected into office. He decried the large scale killings that have touched many parts of the state in recent months noting that he would stick to the enactment of the anti open grazing law in the state, which  would be systematically implemented using the conventional security agencies instead of using the livestock guards.
