As debates on the mode of primary election for the Bauchi State Governorship primaries of the All Progressives Congress (APC) continue, a party stalwart and ardent supporter of the incumbent Governor, Alhaji Garba Musa has stated that Governor Mohammed Abubakar would emerge victorious at the upcoming September 29th primary election whether the exercise is conducted through direct or indirect system and the APC’s internal saboteurs will be defeated at the end. Addressing journalists yesterday, Musa said the governor deserves re-election in view of his performances within the last three years which include the ongoing dualization of six metropolitan roads in Bauchi state capital, construction of 105 kilometers road in Misau local government adding that if Abubakar is not returned in 2019, the projects might be abandoned and the state coffers would be subsequently drained by the those desperate politicians who are in the game to accumulate wealth to the chagrin of the hapless majority. According to him, the three other governorship aspirants namely Dr Ibrahim Yakubu Lame, Captain Bala Jibrin, and Professor Ali Pate are in the race only to destabilize the party in view of their utterances and series of petitions they sent to the national headquarters. “We are not afraid of direct primaries. Our candidate is Governor M.A Abubakar. So, whether direct or indirect primary election is adopted, he will beat other contenders hands down. That is why they are making political noises in the past couple of days because they are afraid of defeat, and I assure you, they and their cohorts in the PDP will never succeed. We’re strongly advising the APC National Working Committee (NWC) to be wary of the subversive elements in the party who are acting a script design by their auxiliaries in the opposition to see the down fall of the APC in Bauchi State.’’ It would be recall that, the Bauchi State Chapter of the APC have adopted indirect mode of the primary election and went further to adopt the incumbent governor as the party’s sole candidate in the 2019 gubernatorial election, and the decision doesn’t go well to those aspiring to slug it out with the governor in the primaries.
