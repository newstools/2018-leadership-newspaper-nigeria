The All Progressives Congress (APC) 2018 Convention Contestants Forum has chided its National Executive Committee (NEC) over the party’s decision to allow State Governors adopt direct/indirect primary elections as a method of choosing candidates for the 2019 general election. In a statement released yesterday and sign by the group’s Chairman, Honourable Isa Umar, the 2018 APC Convention Contestants Forum condemned NEC’s decision to give states leeway to choose between Direct and Indirect Primaries while the Presidential Primary is direct. He said APC as a party belongs to everybody and nobody as well, adding categorically that the party is not for governors alone. “Our Forum stands with what APC faithful across the country want. APC as the ruling party promised to fight corruption and this decision of NEC would not do anything but breed corruption within the party.” The statement read. Umar stressed that respecting the electoral act and the APC’s constitution in the conduct of the party’s primaries is the only way to avert any crisis before 2019 general elections. The statement further deplored the proposed nomination fees and called astronomical and unacceptable in a progressive party. He also urged all APC members to support the cause in bringing justice and fairness in all party’s activities. “We are calling and mobilizing all lovers of President Muhammadu Buhari, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, APC Supports Groups, Civil Society Organisations and APC faithful to come out and oppose this unpopular decision and wait of a date to occupy the APC States and National Secretariat.” He said.
