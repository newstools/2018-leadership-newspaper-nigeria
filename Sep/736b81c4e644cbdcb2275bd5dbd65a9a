Alliance for Cooperating Political Parties (ACPP) has also declared support for the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Alhaji Gboyega Oyetola ahead of Thursday’s governorship rerun in Osun state. Addressing a press conference in Osogbo on Wednesday, the leader of the political group, Prince Adesoji Masilo said the coalition threw their weight behind the candidature of Oyetola because of his intelligence and character. Masilo who was flanked by no fewer than ten chairmen of political parties said APC has proved that it is capable to develop the state, urging members of the coalition to troop out on Thursday and cast their votes for APC. Masilo condemned the rate of vote buying that characterised last Saturday’s governorship election saying politicians should desist from such act. He said voters should refrain from selling their votes and ensure that they vote Oyetola.
