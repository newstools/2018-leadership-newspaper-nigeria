Minister for Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, yesterday declared the All Progressives Congress (APC) would win the 2019 general elections as there is no credible opposition to the party. The minister stated this while fielding questions from newsmen in Benin City yesterday where he attended a wedding ceremony of the son of the Edo Commissioner for Budget and Economic Planning, Hajia Mariam Abubakar. He contended that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which would have provided a “kind of opposition,” was in disarray. He pointed at the performance of the APC as the reason it would win the 2019 general elections, adding that the ruling party was not in the least threatened by the ‘noise’ being made by the PDP. According to him, “I don’t see fear of opposition in the elections. The opposition is in disarray. We believe that the people will vote for performance and, to that, we are very confident; government has not stopped working. We will continue to work for Nigerians to see. “Basically, I don’t see any opposition from the PDP; it is a section of the media that has constituted themselves to the opposition party,” he said. Speaking on the issue of fake news, the minister said the war against the menace was being won. “We have seen fake news gone under. We have been able to drag it under the table. “We must not forget, however, that fake news is a global phenomenon ; it is not peculiar to Nigeria. If not checked, however, it will pitch the people against themselves. “Federal government launched the campaign against fake news because it realised that some very unscrupulous elements have been exploiting the frontline of ethnicity, trying to put a wedge between the government and the people,” he stated.
