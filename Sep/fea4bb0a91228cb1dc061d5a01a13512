pcAt last, it is now clear that aspirants jostling for various political positions under the platform of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Edo State would emerge through indirect primaries. The governor of the state, Mr Godwin Obaseki had preferred consensus which he had earlier deployed to pick candidates for the recently held local government election but the national chairman of APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole preferred direct primaries. LEADERSHIP had learnt few days ago that some leaders of the party supported the consensus option, as they believed that it would be less rancorous and because there is currently no comprehensive voters register to determine the actual number of registered members in the state. A state caucus meeting called late Sunday eventually settled for indirect primaries in nominating its candidates in the coming elections but LEADERSHIP  gathered that the caucus members appealed to the state APC secretariat to see how it can update the membership register to enable them use it for the presidential primaries. A total number of 71 persons that make up the caucus were invited for the meeting which was attended by over 85 per cent of the total number. The caucus is expected to meet with the State Working Committee (SWC) of the party today and then come out with an official position on the decision for indirect primaries which would then be communicated to the national secretariat as directed by the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party in its recent meeting. According to a member of caucus told LEADERSHIP on condition of anonymity that,  “The meeting went well, we are meeting tomorrow (Tuesday) to decide, no consensus. We will meet with the SWC (State Working Committee) to decide whether we will do direct or indirect but they made it clear to us that there is no updated membership registration so we might opt for indirect primaries because there is no comprehensive register. The national chairman addressed us, the governor addressed us and the state chairman addressed us.”
