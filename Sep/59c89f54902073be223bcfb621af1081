The All Progressives Congress (APC) has said that the resignation of Kemi Adeosun as Minister of Finance and acceptance of same by President Muhammadu Buhari is an action of honour, strength, character and integrity. APC acting National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena, that like all responsive and responsible governments concerned about the truth and due process, the APC-led federal government undertook diligent investigation of the allegation. “Now that the report of the investigation is out, the right thing has been done, the honourable Minister has taken the path of honour and resigned.” The APC spokesperson further congratulated Mrs Adeosun for her action and wished her success in her future endeavours, and joined the president in appreciating her immense contributions to the stability of the Nigerian economy in the past three and half years. He added that in Buhari’s administration of integrity and transparency in the conduct of public affairs, no government officer with a modicum of questionable conduct or integrity should stay in office. The statement further said during past PDP administrations, officials refused to honour invitations of the National Assembly; closed down national airports against perceived political adversaries and bought luxurious bullet-proof vehicles with public funds at inflated prices. He recalled that such public officers had also locked out National Assembly members, forcing federal lawmakers to climb high barricades in order to assess the legislative chamber. “It was these acts of corruption, impunity, irresponsibility and executive rascality that made Nigerians vote in the President Buhari administration in 2015, with its change mantra to put a stop to such undemocratic practices,” the statement added.
