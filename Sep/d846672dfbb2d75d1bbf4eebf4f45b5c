The peace and tranquility on the island of Gigha off the western coast of Scotland has been shattered by a burglary said by locals to be the first serious crime in about 20 years. Ken Deacon, who operates the community-owned Gigha Hotel, said Friday about 2,000 pounds ($2,600) was stolen from a storeroom. The theft was discovered Sunday morning. Police are investigating. “I don’t want to make too much of it because I don’t want tourists to stop coming,” said Deacon, who describes the island as idyllic. Most of the island’s 160 residents leave their homes unlocked.
