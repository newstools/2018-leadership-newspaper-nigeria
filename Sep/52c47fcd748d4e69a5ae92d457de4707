Rivers State Governor, Chief Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, has waded into the face-off between youths in the state and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCO) over the planned relocation of the oil firm’s supply base at the Onne Oil and Gas Free Zone, to Lagos State. To this end, Wike will meet the management of Shell Companies in Nigeria (SCiN) and the Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA) as well as the Oil and Gas Free Zone Authority (OGFZA) and other relevant stakeholders to look at the crisis being generated by the planned relocation. Recall that it took the intervention of the traditional ruler in Rivers State, King Michael Ateke Tom and operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) to prevent members of the Rivers State Youth Federation (RSYF) from invading SNEPCO’s supply base on Wednesday. A source close to Government House, Port Harcourt told LEADERSHIP that the governor took the decision after a meeting between the top DSS chiefs and President of RSYF, Comrade Saviour Patrick, following the aborted protest by the youths. According to the source, it was agreed at the meeting, which was attended by representatives of SNEPCO, that the youths would shelve their planned protest while the oil firm would suspend the planned relocation until after the meeting with Wike. He said both DSS and the Rivers State government are concerned about the long term security implication for the state should the relocation to Lagos be executed. The source said: “The youths are upset although the DSS Director told them there was not much they could do, but he is worried that the situation does not degenerate into renewed militant activities in the state.”
