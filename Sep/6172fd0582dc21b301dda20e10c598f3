Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom, has denied media reports credited to the Senator representing Benue North East Senatorial District, Barnabas Gemade, blaming him (Ortom) for his latest defection to Social Democratic Party (SDP). Ortom who denied the allegation through his special adviser on Media and ICTs, Tahav Agerzua maintained that he is not responsible for Gemade’ s defection to SDP. “I have immense respect for the person and political stature of Sen. Gemade and has done everything to accord him his due respect. “However, it should be noted that I does not have the capacity to compel delegates of the PDP to vote for any candidate. “Even for my nomination for reelection, I have embarked on intensive consultation with PDP stakeholders across the state during which I presented my scorecard, while also advancing reasons why they should nominate  me,” he said. Ortom further appealed to other aspirants in the state to consult with delegates and persuade them in similar manner to support their aspirations rather than engage in diversionary moves. “As a Christian and a governor, I believe that a man can receive nothing except it is given to him from above, since the ultimate power belongs to God.”
