Former Jigawa State governor and presidential aspirant under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Sule Lamido, yesterday rebuked former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, for asking him (Lamido) to step down for him ahead of the PDP presidential primaries. Lamido who denied accepting to step down for Atiku, declared that he was already a member of the House of Representatives in 1979 when former vice president was an employee of the Nigeria Customs Service. Atiku had on Monday reportedly  asked the former Jigawa State governor Dr. Sule Lamido to step down for him ahead of the October 6 presidential primary of the PDP. The former Vice President had made the appeal in the PDP secretariat in Dutse, Jigawa State during his visit to the state as part of his tour to rally for support ahead of the party’s presidential primaries. Atiku referring Lamido as his younger brother, related the incident with what happened in 1993 election under the Social Democratic Party (SDP) when he (Atiku) stepped down for Shehu Musa Yar’Adua. Reacting to Atiku’s statement, Lamido who spoke through his media aide, Adamu Muhd Usman, said, “While it is true he is older than me age wise, I’m senior to him politically because I was in the House of Representatives in 1979 when he was an employee of Nigerian Customs Services. And if age is the criterion for standing election then he should drop out for Buhari.” He added, “Despite all odds, Lamido has been patient, loyal, committed and consistence. Even if Lamido did not show interest to contest, PDP should have called Lamido to be the flag bearer and if there is anyone the other aspirants should step down for, it should be Sule Lamido because he has the good and political will, experience and capacity to confront the ruling party, APC. Also if Lamido is to step down, why would he aspire in the first place? Sule Lamido is out to run for the president come 2019 God willing.”
