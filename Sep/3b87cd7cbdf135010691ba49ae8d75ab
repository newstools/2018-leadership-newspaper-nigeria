Prior to the demise of the officer who has been identified as Sunday, he was in charge of the works department of the Police college and was due to retire next month, according to the report given by police. Pulse Nigeria reported that, the single mother of two with whom the deceased Superintendent of police had been having sex with before his death was reported to have been detained by detectives. “He always used to have sex with me in his office, he had already gone once, but as usual, he was not satisfied. In fact, I told him on that day that the drugs he used to take any time we want to have sex are not too good for my body.” “I didn’t like it because I was the person that used to bear the brunt of it. He would be pounding into me for a very long time because of the drug. He usually takes longer to cum. On that fateful day, after he went first on the round, he refused to allow me to dress.” “He started playing with me until his manhood became turgid again. He then started pounding into me again,” She narrated to the Police. She revealed that it only came to her notice that something had gone wrong when the officer’s tongue began to protrude and foams emanating from his mouth. She quickly ran out and started screaming for help, with her brassieres dangling. Yabaleftonline.ng reported that by the time people arrived, the recently promoted officer had already passed away. According to Pulse, the police officer’s subordinates are reported to have said that the deceased was fond of bringing different women into his office for sex, including pestering new female recruits with sex demands. His body has since been deposited at Ikeja General Hospital for an autopsy.
