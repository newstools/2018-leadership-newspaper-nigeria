An All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirant in Adamawa State, Dr Mahmood Halilu, has said a consensus candidate is expected to emerge, between him and pioneer EFFC chairman, Nuhu Ribadu, tomorrow ahead of Saturday’s primaries in Adamawa State. Halilu said, the decision was in the best interest of the people and the state, to form a formidable candidate to fly the party’s flag in the forthcoming APC primaries. He stated that, consultations have been concluded and the consensus candidate would be announced tomorrow Friday.
According to him, the Governors’ Forum has approached him, to vie for senatorial seat, to give way for incumbent Governor Bindow which he refused.
He accused Governor Bindow’s administration for his failure, to address farmers/ herders crisis, especially in the southern zone of the state. “The nonchalant attitude of Governor Bindow in addressing farmers/herders crisis in the southern zone, of the state is worrisome.
“Discussion is still ongoing hopefully by tomorrow single candidates would merge between Halilu and Ribadu.
“I looked at Governor Bindow, as person who failed his responsibilities for the people of the state.
“The Governor’s Forum, which Governor Bindow is a member, mounted pressure on me, to pick senatorial ticket which I refused.
“I am contesting with Governor Bindow, side by side to correct the underdevelopment in the state.”
