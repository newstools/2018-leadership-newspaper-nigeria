Barely 48 hours after failed attempts by Governor Ibrahim Hassan Dankwambo and some political bigwigs to convince the Gafakan Akko and former campaign coordinator of Sen. Ahmed Makarfi, Auwal Abdullahi to remain in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the PDP in the state has again suffered another big blow as the younger brother to the Governor, Babangida Mohammad Dankwambo popularly known as BMD formally decamped to the All Progressive Congress (APC) on Saturday afternoon. LEADERSHIP reports that BMD, until his defection had been under pressure from different quarters to reverse his decision. We gathered that he was given juicy offers but he rejected them. A government insider told LEADERSHIP that the efforts to stop BMD from moving to APC was not because of his political relevance but because it will be embarrassing for the blood brother of a sitting governor who is aspiring to be the president of Nigeria to decamped to an opposition party “obviously something is wrong, it shows that the governor is not capable of managing situations around him.” “We felt we could manage the situation but unfortunately it was above our ability” our source who refused to tell our correspondent details of what transpired, simply said, “the governor takes the highest proportion of the blame in the whole act.” Our correspondent gathered that BMD was formally presented with his membership card by the chairman of his Ajiya ward in Gombe north constituency after he registered. Our correspondent further learnt that hundreds of his supporters would also join him in APC when he would be formally presented to the state leadership of the party in a grand reception in Gombe, the state capital. BMD told LEADERSHIP in a telephone chat that he decided to join APC on grounds of several conditions and convictions. He said “some people in the PDP have decided not to be fair to me and since PDP cannot accommodate me I decided to move to the APC to pursue my political ambition.” He said.
