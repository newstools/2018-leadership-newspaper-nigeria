Kebbi Development Forum, a non-partisan organisation based in Kebbi State with the main objective of fostering unity and development has frowned against using consensus arrangement to nominate candidates of APC for the 2019 general elections. The secretary general of the organisation, Usman Abubakar stated this during a press conference in Birnin Kebbi over the recent political developments in Kebbi State and Nigeria. He said this arrangement would give room for certain retrogressive and anti-democratic elements to unilaterally impose flag bearers on the people of Kebbi State. “The so-called consensus adopting the incumbent governor as the sole candidate of APC for 2019 and other elective offices reflects a mindset on the part of those unpatriotic elements to perpetrate poor governance on people of Kebbi State that are grappling with huge issues of poverty, unemployment, inclusiveness ,development and civil service discontent. “How in a democratic setting, can a few individuals benefitting from the system, simply because they fraudulently acquired party machinery, hijack the will of the majority, who is afraid of direct primaries? Why can’t they follow the footsteps of Mr President if they truly hold his principles so dear? “Why is direct primaries acceptable at the presidential level, where there is no competition and not applicable at state where you have multiple aspirants, whose rights have clearly been infringed upon?” he asked.
