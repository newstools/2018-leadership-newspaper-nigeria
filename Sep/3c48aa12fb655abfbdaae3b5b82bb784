He urged them to work together and unite to ensure that the party wins the 2019 general elections. According to him, “We should come, work and unite together to reject APC in 2019 general elections.” Atiku who noted that Oyo State belongs to the PDP, urged the people to make sure that the party did not only win the state but at the federal level. “Reject APC at the poll so that by the grace of God, the state and the centre will be governed by the PDP governor and President,” he said.
