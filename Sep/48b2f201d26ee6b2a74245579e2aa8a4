Senator Khairat Abdulrazaq Gwadabe, who represented the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in the 4th Senate, from 1999 to 2003, has hinted on her plan to return to the Senate after almost 16 years. Speaking with journalists in Abuja, yesterday, Senator Gwadabe said her resolve to return to the Senate was borne out of the fact that Abuja residents, especially FCT indigenes, were currently poorly represented at the centre. She lamented that FCT people have lost their voice since she left the Upper Chamber in 2003. As she declares her intention to run for the Senate again, today, on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), the former senator said she understands the terrains of the FCT enough to know what the people need. She said, “If it is the quality of representation that is causing the people to suffer political neglect, then I am ready to throw in the towel. The highest office anyone can aspire to in FCT here is the senatorial seat. Even though it is a legislative seat, you can use it to ensure that you have better politics. These were things that agitated my mind. “I have consulted with all the political wards in the FCT. The feedbacks I got were frightening to me. They complained of poor representation, and now said ‘you represented us well. Why don’t you come out again?’ “Some aspirants have told me in the past that when they went on campaign, the people would say they would vote for them if they promised to represent them as well as I did when I was in the Senate.”
