In keeping faith with the demand of labour union to avoid frosty relationship in the present dispensation, the Kogi State governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, has pledged to pay the minimum wage that is agreed upon by the tripartite committee set up by the federal government. The chairman of the concerned Kogi State Workers’ Forum, an informed organisation based in Lokoja, Kogi State, Com Adex Shaibu, made the statement at a conference in Lokoja, yesterday. Com Adex stressed that this is in spite of the impasse in the committee’s meeting that led to the national leadership of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) giving a 14- day ultimatum to finish and announce a new minimum wage. The chairman stated,  “I am however pleased to assure the Kogi State workers that the state government, ably led by Alh Yahaya Bello, has expressed ability and willingness to pay whatever is agreed upon by the federal government. Adex said that labour was not happy with the unnecessary delay on the issue of new minimum wage, particularly since the tripartite committee was set up in 2017 and held public hearing in the six geo-political zones in Nigeria. “We condemn in strong terms any attempt by failed politicians to distract the present administration in the state from its “new direction agenda”, Com Adex hinted. Calling on the workers in Kogi State not to subject to lies and rumour and unsubstantiated news, Com Adex noted that governance is about physical, socio-economic development, accountability and integrity. He said Governor Yahaya Bello’s administration was laying a great and sustainable foundation for the welfare and economic prosperity of all the people of the state. However, Com Adex urged Governor Bello to key into the policy direction of the national chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), Com Adams Oshiomole, which is anchored on the principle of “Let the people lead”, adding that by this singular action, there will be sustainable development, good governance and transparency.
