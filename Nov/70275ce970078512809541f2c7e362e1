A stalwart of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Plateau State, Isaac Wadak has said that the recent apology by Governor Simon Lalong to the Nigerian army on behalf of the people of Plateau State over the alleged killing of Gen Idris Alkali was rather too hasty. Our correspondent recalled that Gen Alkali was declared missing by the Nigerian Army on the 3rd of September, 2018 on transit from Abuja en route Jos to Bauchi. Speaking to LEADERSHIP in Jos, the Plateau State capital, Wadak said, “Let me say that the killing of General Alkali is unfortunate and condemnable by any sane person. This is because nobody has the right to take the life of another, therefore, whoever that is found responsible for the heinous crime should be brought to book. “Consequently, my sympathy goes to the family of the late general and those close to him. On Governor Lalong’s apology to the Nigerian army on behalf of the people of Plateau State, I would say it’s rather hasty because I understand those alleged to have carried out the crime have been charged to court, so we should await the outcome of the court verdict before any other decision.” “But the governor has already offered an apology. Only God knows why he chooses to be hasty about it. What does he really want to achieve by doing that? Whatever it is, I hope it would not portray the people of Plateau State in bad light,” he added. He further stressed, “Putting it in proper perspective, he should have waited for the pronouncement of the court on those who actually committed the act before any apology. Even then, such an apology should be on behalf of the individual; that is those that were found guilty of committing the crime and not on behalf of all the people of the state.”
