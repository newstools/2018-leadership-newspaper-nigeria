Former president of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Omar AbdulWaheedÂ  has commended the federal government for acceding to the demand of organised labour on the new minimum wage which averted the nationwide strike at the last minute that would have paralysed the country. He made the commendation in Abuja during a chat with journalists after the submission of the tripartite committee report on the new minimum wage to President Muhammadu Buhari by the committee headed by Mrs. Amma Peppe. He however, called on the federal government and the National Assembly to expedite action on the process leading to the amendment of the law as required by the National New Minimum Wage Act of 2005 to reflect the N30,000 as the new minimum wage as agreed by both parties. He equally, enjoined the state governors to follow suit in domesticating same law in their various states to avoid further rancour and impending strike by the labour unions at the state levels. He recalled how some governors deliberately refused to implement similar salary increment during former President Goodluck Jonathan administration with the issue being dragged for years before it was finally implemented. He argued that, once the act is passed by the National Assembly and signed by the President, it has become a law as such it has become obligatory upon state governors and organised private sector to implement it or they will be violating the laws of the land. Mr. Omar also commended the labour unions for their magnanimity and maturity during the negotiation period and hoped that they would reciprocate the gesture by attending to their duties with all sense of responsibility and diligence.
