The All Progressives Congress (APC) has denied that its national Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole was detained by the officers of the Department of State Services (DSS) as reported by the media. LEADERSHIP reports that the APC Chairman was alleged to have been invited for questioning Sunday night following petitions from some aggrieved governors of the party, accusing him of subverting the recent primary elections of the party. However, reacting to reports of the questioning of the chairman, National Publicity Secretary of the party, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu said Mr Oshiomhole is currently out of the country and could not immediately respond to the “rumour”. The party said Comrade Oshiomhole traveled abroad Monday on personal grounds, declining further details about the trip. He said: “We do not have any information on this rumour. More so, the Chairman is not around in the country to confirm or deny this. As soon as we have any relevant information, you’ll be updated” The DSS operatives were said to have asked him to resign following a deluge of complaints about his handling of the party primaries.
