Last week, the Academic Staff Union Of Universities (ASUU) did what it actually knows how to do best-embarking on strike. The union, which is supposed to be a conglomerate of educated minds sees strike as the only weapon to press home their demands. I am sick and tired of ASUU going on strike at the drop of a hat. The strikes are always on the same issues for the past 10 years the demands are always the same. The question on my GPS is since the academic union has been embarking on strikes, has our educational system improved?  Instead, it has deteriorated and we are preparing its final burial rites. The University of Ibadan (UI) is the only Nigerian university among the top 1,000 universities in the world. The premier Nigerian university is ranked 991st worldwide, and 14th in Africa, according to the 2018/19 edition of the global ranking released earlier this year by the Centre for World University Rankings (CWUR). Apart from UI, no other Nigerian university is listed on the CWUR’s global ranking. In the past 10 years, the number of private universities in the country has increased because public schools are no longer an option due to incessant strikes by ASUU. So, what has all the industrial actions embarked on by ASUU achieved? The story is always the same; they go on strike and after some months of negotiations, government is blackmailed into signing agreements it knows it cannot implement. The strike is called off and after some months when the resolutions are not implemented, they go on another round of strikes. At the end of the day, they end up prolonging students’ stay in school and nothing is achieved. The federal government should also stop signing agreements it knows it can’t implement, as that is a recipe for future strikes. For now, ASUU should come off its high horse and call off this ill-timed strike.
