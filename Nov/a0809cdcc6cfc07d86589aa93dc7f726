Leaders of the Nasarawa State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) are divided over who to support for the 2019 governorship election, Specifically, the CAN leaders have narrowed their options to two candidates: David Ombugadu of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and Labaran Maku of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA). Former president, Youth Wing of CAN and present national chairman of Global Christian Network, Mr. Daniel Kazai, dropped the hint yesterday in Lafia, when he addressed Christian communities in Nasarawa. The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has chosen Abdullahi Sule, a Muslim as its governorship candidate while the PDP and APGA picked Christians as their candidates. Kazai however advised the church leaders to bring the two candidates together and choose one of them to face the APC in the 2019 governorship election otherwise the agitations for a Christian governor would be a mirage. He said: “Nasarawa State has for long discriminated against Christians in the selection of its governors despite the fact that Christians constitute over 50 per cent of the state population, “The time for redress has come, not only because it is just but because many Christians have realised that their votes have been taken for granted. “The powerless post of deputy governor has been reserved for us Christians, which means we are regarded as second class citizens despite the fact that we contribute maximally to the revenue of the state and stabilise crime because of the Christian value. “Even in the midst of crisis , you discover that the Christian youths don’t retaliate or get provoked, it is because of what we learnt in the church, and if we are doing all this and suddenly we don’t have a fair share of governance in Nasarawa State , it means something is wrong somewhere,” he said. He urged the church leaders to immediately meet and pick a consensus candidate between the two or the youths would team up with one of the candidates during the elections.
