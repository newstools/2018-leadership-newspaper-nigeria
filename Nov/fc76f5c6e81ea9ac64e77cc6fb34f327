The Nigerian Army announced yesterday that its troops have killed two high profile Boko Haram commanders during joint operations by military formations stationed in Chibok and Damboa communities of Borno State. The Nigerian Army, which gave this hint on its official Facebook page, said Abu Rajal and Tuja Sa’inna Banki were killed during the joint clearance operations. It said that troops of 25 Task Force Brigade, Chibok, and 28 Task Force Brigade, Damboa, embarked on joint clearance operations from Gumsuri to Gambori in Borno State during which they liberated villages and recovered items from the terrorists. The director of Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Texas Chukwu, said the troops liberated Litawa Kashmiri, Dole, Mulimari, Munchies, Njaba, Bale and Gambori villages. He noted that during the operations, the troops engaged the insurgents at Mude where the terrorists fled in disarray due to the superior firepower of the troops, leaving behind 17 bicycles, one small solar panel, two Tecno phones, sets of bicycle spokes, 12 torchlights, five Adorline body jelly, one UNICEF bag, some foodstuffs, used spinners, cloths, four mosquito nets, four-litre jerry can of petrol, 10 blankets and eight prayer mats. “Reports just reaching Headquarters, Nigerian Army, has confirmed that two high profile BHT (Boko Haram Terrorists) commanders named Abu Rajal and Tuja Sa’inna Banki were killed during the clearance operations,” Chukwu stated. According to him, the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt Gen TY Buratai has commended the gallant troops and urged them to carry out further incursions and clearance operations to ensure that the remnants of the BHT are completely wiped out.
