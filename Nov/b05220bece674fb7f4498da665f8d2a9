Commander, Operation Whirl Stroke, has identified rumour peddling among politicians on the current farmers/herders’ crises in the state as being responsible for insecurity tension, which is creating unnecessary fear and panic in the minds of Internally Displaced Persons. Major General Adeyemi Yekini, who made this known in Makurdi during presentation of the troops’ scorecard in the last six weeks by the director of Defence Information, Brigadier General John Agim, cautioned against playing politics with the crisis situation to heighten tension especially now that 2019 is around the corner. Brigadier General Agim disclosed that in the last six weeks of operation, troops have neutralised 17-armed militiamen across the three joint operation areas of Benue, Taraba and Nasarawa States while 11 suspects were arrested. Agim explained that, operation 777, which was launched on the 18th of October, 2018 was to re- energise the already existing operations all over the country in order to close gaps, so that criminal elements would not escape from one theatre of operation to the other. “Op 777 is designed to destroy all remnants of armed militia camps in the OPWS, JOA to mop up illegal arms and create conducive atmosphere for the remaining IDPs to return to their ancestral homes.” According to him, “all in all the troops have conducted a total of 49 offensive operations and 13 non- kinetic activities out of which 10 were against Gana and his militia men.” “These operations have helped in the recovery of 57 weapons, 27 AK 47 magazines and 1,311 rounds of ammunition while a total of 83 suspects all in all, have been arrested and are undergoing various interrogations.” While pledging their total commitment towards the restoration of lasting peace in the affected states, Brigadier Agim disclosed that a total number of 157, 000 IDPs have already returned to their communities in the Joint Operation Areas.
