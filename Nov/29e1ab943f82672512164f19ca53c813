The statement noted that the killing of the media leader is a demonstration of Nigerian Army’s efforts to eliminate key members of the sect. ‘‘The death of the group’s media leader shows that the leadership is being targeted successfully and soon, other key members would be apprehended or neutralised, thus decimating the group and its activities.” The statement further noted that the sect is directly affiliated to the Islamic State and has been carrying out deadly attacks on innocent civilians and Nigerian troops. “It is worthy to note that the sect is directly affiliated to the Islamic State and has carried out several attacks against our troops and innocent civilians in the past.’’ The statement further averred that the new leader of Jama’atu Nus’ratul-Islami Wal-Muslimina, Abul- Fadl Iyad Gali has also been identified. It explained that the group is a new terrorist group which Ansaru is affiliated to. It added that the identification of the leader of Jama’atu Nus’ratul-Islami Wal-Muslimina group would enable the Army target the group effectively, using advanced technologies in its arsenal. “This is as the existence of the group portends grave danger to Nigeria’s national security,” it said.
