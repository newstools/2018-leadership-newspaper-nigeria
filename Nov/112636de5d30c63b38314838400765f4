The National Examinations Council (NECO) has announced an extension of time for applicants wishing to register as walk-in candidates for its November/December 2018 SSCE examination. Acting registrar of NECO, Mr Abubakar Gana, who disclosed this in a statement over the weekend, said the extension became necessary following the expiration of registration deadline last Saturday, November 17, 2018. Gana advised all candidates who failed to meet the registration deadline to take advantage of the window of opportunity provided by the management and register for the examination as walk-in candidates. The NECO boss however urged candidates registering after the closing date to adhere to guidelines governing the process, warning that such candidates must complete their registration within twenty- four hours to the scheduled time of the paper(s) that they intend to sit for. He further noted that a nonrefundable fee of N20, 000 would be paid per candidate as registration fee to NECO TSA and evidence of payment presented at the NECO State Office. Candidates are to collect activated registration scratch cards from NECO State Office. Biometrics enrollment is mandatory for this examination. Candidates are to report to the examination centre on the date and time of the scheduled examination with evidence of registration (Photocard). The council has scheduled its November/December Senior School Certificate Examination (SSCE) to commence on Monday, November 19, and end on Wednesday, December 19, 2018. .
