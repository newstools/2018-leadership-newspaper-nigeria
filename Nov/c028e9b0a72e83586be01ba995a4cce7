The atmosphere however became rowdy when the governor arrived at the assembly complex at Udo Udoma Avenue.  NAN also learnt that immediately Gov. Emmanuel entered the premises, gunshots were fired by those described by eyewitnesses as security operatives and thugs who were around the premises.  According to the witnesses the newly acclaimed speaker, Mr Nse Ntuen, who had earlier sat with the four other lawmakers, were also harassed by security personnel in the assembly premises.

The eyewitnesses said: “As the governor entered the assembly hall, youth started shouting ‘eight years, eight years.”  Some journalists who were in the assembly for the day’s duty, had to scamper for their lives, scaling the fence.
