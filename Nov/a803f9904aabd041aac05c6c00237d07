Top Kwara State All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain, Muhammad Dele Belgore, SAN, has called on his supporters within and outside the party to vote en masse for Abdulraheem Tunji Olawuyi (Ajulo), the party’s candidate in the November 17 House of Representatives bye-election in Irepodun/Isin/Ekiti/Oke Ero federal constituency. “I call on our supporters within and outside the party fold to mobilise and vote for the candidate of our party Ajulo. He is certain to offer the best representation for the people because he has always been part of the movement to liberate Kwara,” Belgore said in a statement on Tuesday. Belgore said a victory for the candidate would help to strengthen the bid to win other elections in 2019 as well as help to advance the change agenda of President Muhammadu Buhari in the parliament. “We urge our people to make a bold statement with this bye-election.  We should say enough is enough. We should use this election to tell the rest of Nigeria that we are a people committed to moving Nigeria forward. We should use this election to tell the rest of Nigeria that we are not in support of those who are using the parliament to stall the progress of this country,” the senior advocate added. He called on party leaders and foot soldiers within and outside Kwara South where the election is holding to stand by the candidate with everything in their power.
