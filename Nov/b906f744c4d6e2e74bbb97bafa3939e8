The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said that its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, has worked out a pricing template that will immediately crash the pump price of fuel in the country. The party said its candidate will do this because the President Muhammadu Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC) administration has failed to do the needful in the last three years. The PDP also said that it completely rejects the Buhari-led federal  government’s increase of the official prices of diesel and kerosene,  stating that such will bring more economic pressure on the already  impoverished nation, as most businesses and homes across the country heavily depend on these products for sustenance. The national publicity secretary of PDP, Kola  Ologbondiyan, in a statement  said the party has been in high level talks with top international players in the oil and gas industry, adding that its engagements has shown that the appropriate pump price of fuel in the Nigerian market, under the current subsidy regimes of the Buhari  Presidency, should be within the borders of N87 to N90 per liter as against the N145 currently being charged. The PDP said, “With the current price template of crude oil in the  international market, the Buhari administration has no justification to  keep the pump price of fuel at N145 per liter and watch Nigerians groan  under the weight of high prices, while a cabal at the presidency loot  the funds meant to subsidize the product.” The PDP further noted that “for every N145 paid for a liter of fuel, the  Presidency cabal diverts a hidden N58 which Nigerians have continued to  pay since the fuel price was increased from N87 to presumably subsidized  cost of N145. “Apart from failing to account for the over N1.4 trillion allegedly  siphoned through sleazy oil subsidy deals, the Buhari-led federal  government is burdened to account for the over N3.49 trillion stolen  under the hidden N58 per liter of fuel on over 50 million daily domestic  consumption estimated in the last three years.” The PDP however noted that had the Buhari administration heed wise counsel to be transparent in its dealings in governance and to engage more experienced hands on petroleum issues, the nation would not have been in the dire straits it faces today. The party however urged Nigerians not to despair as its presidential  candidate, Atiku Abubakar, has already worked out a blueprint that will  end sleazes, ensure appropriate pricing template and free resources to  guarantee availability of product on a national pricing regime.
