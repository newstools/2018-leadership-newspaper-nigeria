The Acting General Officer Commanding (GOC) 7 Division Brigadier General Abdulmalik Bulama Biu has charged troops of Operation LAFIYA DOLE to be alert, courageous and more decisive in the fight against Boko Haram Terrorists (BHTs) in North East Nigeria. Biu gave the charge during his operational visit to assess the combat readiness of troops of 82 Task Force Battalion in Ngwoshe, Gwoza Local Government Area of Borno State, according to a statement by Brigadier Texas Chukwu, Army spokesman. It was the first statement out of three to be signed by Chukwu in the last 48 hours, in the wake of the reports of huge losses by Nigerian Army to Boko Haram in Metele, Borno State.

He advised the troops to be more decisive in their approach in confronting the terrorists and endeavour to work in synergy with other security agencies. General Biu assured the troops that their welfare would receive all necessary support it requires from the Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Tukur Yusufu Buratai. He urged them to be confident, professional and work assiduously towards ending the insurgency and other sundry crimes in the North East of Nigeria. The GOC who was accompanied by the Commander 47 Engineer Brigade Brigadier General Ignatius Nwogu and other Principal Staff Officers visited troops locations at Banki Junction, Firgi Pulka, Gwoza and Yamteke in Gwoza Local Government of Borno State.
