The national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, yesterday debunked reports that he was arrested, detained and granted administrative bail by the Department of State Services (DSS) after a nine-hour interrogation. The former governor of Edo State who spoke with Journalists in Lagos maintained that he only met with DSS officials once and had conversation with them, saying, “It was not an arrest or detention. “The conversation centred around APC primaries. The question now is whether or not it is the DSS job to interfere in a political party’s issues. And if there’s an allegation of corruption, it is the responsibility of EFCC and ICPC”, he added. Oshiomhole said the DSS did not reschedule another meeting with him as reported in the media. He insisted that he was not released on administrative bail, even as he spurned reports that that Kogi State governor, Yahaya Bello, came to pick him up from the DSS office. Oshiomhole who came back to Nigeria on Friday after visiting his wife and APC national leader, Bola Tinubu, in the US and UK respectively said, “I was the one who called Yahaya Bello and he came but I drove home in my own car.” Reacting to the Peoples Democratic Party’s call to arrest him, he said, “What would they have said if it was the PDP chairman that was invited by DSS, for instance, over the dollar bazaar at their Port Harcourt primary? “They would have said democracy is under threat and would have fired a letter to the UN as they often ridicule themselves.”
