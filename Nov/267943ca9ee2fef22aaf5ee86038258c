The National vice president of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) Comrade Amaechi Asugwuni has urged workers in the country to vote out all state governors that are opposed to the payment of the new minimum wage of N30, 000 to workers. Speaking at the inauguration of the new National Administrative Council NAC of the National Union of Air Transport Employees (NUATE) , Comrade Asugwuni held at the weekend in Lagos, revealed that there was no reason for governors not to pay the new minimum wage as soon as all processes have been concluded. According to the NLC vice president, some governors have officially written to the NLC that they will be able to pay the new minimum wage saying that there was no governor that will be able to stand before the state workers to decline payment. ” I am telling Nigerians that any governor that undermined the payment of minimum wage should be voted out. They are hiding under the governors forum not to pay but they have confirmed to us and written us that they can pay the minimum wage. “N30, 000 is not even the money that can be take anybody home. The president as a matter of urgency should transmit that minimum wage document to the National Assembly” Asugwuni said there was no going back on the new minimum wage and urged workers to gear up for the great battle ahead in order to ensure that the struggle continued without hindrance should they refused to pay. He called on the newly inaugurated executive of NUATE to put their house in order and forge ahead saying, that the aviation industry remained one of the strongest affiliates of the NLC hence the president of the NLC visited the new NUATE President within a month after election.
