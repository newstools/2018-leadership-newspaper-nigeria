There was pandemonium, yesterday, at the Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly as a giant white Owl stormed the chamber in what observers saw as the beginning of “a diabolical chapter, “in the ongoing crises in the 6th Assembly. The House had adjourned the plenary after the rowdy situation at the complex on Tuesday, but had to immediately reconvene on Thursday for a valedictory session in honour of a former member, Dr Clement Bassey (Ikono), who died few months ago. However, some shocked Assembly workers, who gathered in groups were seen discussing the incident in hush tones, accusing the five former Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) members, who defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC), of going spiritual to address their grievances. Acting on the ruling of the Federal High Court sitting in Uyo, the state capital, Speaker Luke had declared their seats vacant, leading to the ongoing crises in the House in the last two weeks. They include the factional ‘Speaker’, Mr Nse Ntuen (Essien Udim); Idongesit Ituen (Itu), Victor Udofia (Ikono), Gabriel Toby (Etim Ekpo\Ika) and Otobong Ndem (Mkpat Enin). The five had sat last week claiming to have impeached the duly elected Speaker, Onofiok Luke (Nsit Ubium) with Ntuen, ‘elected’ in his stead. Although, it was still unclear at the time of filing this report as to how the giant white Owl gained entry into the hallowed chamber, the chief press secretary (CPS) to the Speaker, Mr Kufre Okon, who confirmed the incident, said “the bird did not deter the members from holding the valedictory session in honour of Dr Clement Bassey, a former member who died recently”. The Speaker has secured injunction at the state’s High Court, which bars Ntuen from further parading himself as the parallel ‘Speaker’ and four others from returning to their seats.
