Troops of 120 Battalion deployed in ‘Operation Lafiya Dole’ have successfully foiled an attempt by Boko Haram insurgents to attack one of their locations at Katarko,  in Gujba local government area of Yobe State following a tip off. A statement issued in Maiduguri by the director of Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Texas Chukwu, said the troops immediately swung into action and were able to push the terrorists backward using superior firepower, forcing some members of the terrorists group to escape into nearby bushes. According to him, efforts are ongoing by troops to nab the fleeing members of the group. “Meanwhile, the situation has been brought under control by the troops who are currently embarking on clearance patrol. “Residents of Yobe State in general and Katarko in particular are advised to go about their legitimate businesses and to report any suspicious activities or movement in their area to the law enforcement agents for prompt action,” the statement added.
