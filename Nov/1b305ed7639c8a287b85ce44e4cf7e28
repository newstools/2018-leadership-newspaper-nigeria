Ahead of next year’s general elections, the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has boasted that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) would lose at the polls because the APC does not deserve a second term in office. Mr. Ken Nwadinobi, the national coordinator of Atiku: Change the Change for Progress, made this assertion yesterday at the launch of the Katsina State chapter of the PDP presidential campaign support group. Nwadinobi, who was represented by the PDP National Secretary, Senator Umar Tsauri, urged the people of the state and Nigeria not to entertain any fear about Atiku as he would serve them well and diligently, adding that the party was not unaware of their plights. He said that it was for that reason that all eligible Nigerians should vote en mass for Atiku as president, pointing out that Katsina, being the second home of Atiku, would benefit immensely as he consolidates on the feat of the late Katsina-born President Umar Musa Yar’Adua’s administration. On their part, former executive secretary of PTDF, Engr. Muttaqa Rabe Darma and other chieftains of the PDP, urged Nigerian to use their vote to express their dissatisfaction with President Muhammdu Buhari for his inability to fight insecurity and poverty in the country. Darma lamented that the failure of the APC-led government to tackle insurgency, kidnapping and armed robbery. In his remarks, the state PDP chairman and running-mate of the party’s governorship candidate, Yusuf Salisu Majigir, said that the state would give Atiku overwhelming support because he is a political ally of the late Gen. Shehu Musa Yar’Adua, who asked his (Shehu’s) supporters and associates in Katsina and across the country to support Atiku’s presidential ambition before he (Shehu) passed on. Similarly, the former state PDP chairman, Kabir Maiwada Daudawa, said that the success of the party depended on the delegates who should go from door-to-door at the grassroots to mobilise the electorate for Atiku.
