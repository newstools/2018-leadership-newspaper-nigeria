The PDP Governance Grassroot Group (PG3) has charged Nigerians to support Alhaji Atiku Abubakar in bringing back the glory of the country. The group in a statement signed by Amechi Ekpeneru said that PDP has produced candidates who are capable of bringing transformation. According to the statement: “We remember how the Obasanjo/Atiku administration engineered economic development, such as the GSM revolution, payment of debts etc. “We also remember that era witnessed unity as Fulani’s, Yoruba’s, Igbo’s, the minorities etc were fully integrated. “We urge Nigerians to eschew politics of bitterness as the campaign period is set to commence. We declare to Nigerians that Atiku Abubakar represents peace. “PDP was magnanimous in defeat and is poised to continue the economic, social and political transformation truncated in the last three years,” the statement added.
