The Nigerian Air Force (NAF), through the Air Task Force (ATF) of ‘Operation Lafiya Dole,’ has destroyed a Boko Haram camp and neutralised several terrorists in Ngwuri Gana in Borno State. NAF director of public relations and information, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, disclosed that the operation was carried out yesterday  based on human intelligence reports which revealed that the settlement was one of the locations from where the insurgents launched attacks against  troops’ positions and villages around the general area of Kumshe. Daramola said that the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions had confirmed the presence of a large number of Boko Haram terrorists in the settlement before the attack was launched. He explained that a suspected communications centre, with Boko Haram flag and solar panels mounted on it, was identified. “The ATF launched a coordinated attack on various targets within the settlement, employing Alpha Jet and F-7Ni aircraft as well as Mi-35 attack helicopters, leading to the destruction of the communication centre and the neutralisation of several terrorists,” Daramola said. According to him, NAF was working in concert with ground forces and would sustain the tempo of operations with a view to destroying all remnants of the terrorists in Borno.
