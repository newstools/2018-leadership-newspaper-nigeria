Economic and Financial Crimes Commission ( EFCC), yesterday, explained that constitutional immunity from criminal proceedings is the reason why it can’t move against Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State who is accused of receiving millions of dollars in bribe. This comment is coming after EFCC chairman,  Ibrahim Magu refused to answer question about Ganduje at a recent press conference. Part of the statement the EFCC posted on its Twitter handle during a tweet meet organised by Tap Nitiative for Citizens Development, a public accountability think-tank, noted that “the governor is still serving and constitutionally is covered by immunity. Being that as it may, the matter is in the instance sub judice,” When Tap Nitiative demanded further explanation because the EFCC moved against Ayo Fayose while he was the governor of Ekiti State, the anti-graft office said it does not usually “give out information on investigations.” “Investigation of anyone for an alleged fraud remains a covert process,” the EFCC added. Recall that Ganduje has been accused of engaging in brazen contract racketeering after videos appearing to show him collecting bribes were released. In the video posted by Daily Nigerian, an online-based publication, Ganduje could be seen receiving wads of United States dollars from persons believed to be contractors. The videos were allegedly recorded in 2017 and aimed at beaming the spotlight on the governor’s alleged penchant for contract racketeering. However,  the governor had dismissed the videos as “cloned” and filed a lawsuit against the publisher of the online newspaper, Jaafar Jaafar.
