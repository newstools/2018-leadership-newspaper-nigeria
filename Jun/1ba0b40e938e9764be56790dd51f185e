There appears to be a battle of supremacy between the permanent secretary (PS) in the Federal Ministry of Science and Technology, Dr Amina Shamaki, and the Minister, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, over the appointment of an acting director general (DG) for National Biotechnology Development Agency (NABDA). The issue of who mounts the saddle had been in contention for many months until the minister last Thursday appointed the most senior director in the agency, Professor Alex Akpa, as the acting DG of NABDA after receiving the counsel of the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF). Documents sighted by our reporter showed that the minister had directed the incumbent Overseeing DG, Pharm Abayomi Oguntunde, to hand over to the new appointee and return to his duty post as a director at FMS&T immediately. The imbroglio came to the limelight, when the tenure of the former DG, Prof. Lucy Ogbadu ended and the most senior research director was not appointed in line with the directive of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr Boss Mustapha. The circular from the SGF to all ministers, had stated that at the end tenure of a chief executive officer of a parastatal, he or she should hand over to the most senior director. It was however gathered that the permanent secretary resisted and refused to effect the appointment of Prof Akpa, who is the most senior research director at the agency, based on allegations of misconduct. The permanent secretary had gone ahead to unilaterally advertise and shortlist candidates for the position without the approval of the minister. NABDA is one of the five research institutes whose Governing Boards are headed by Dr. Shamaki. It was also gathered that the overseeing DG is yet to hand over to Prof Akpa. Sources in the ministry said the permanent secretary has gone ahead to convene an emergency meeting of the Governing Board of the agency on Monday, June 4 to interview and appoint a substantive DG on the same day.
