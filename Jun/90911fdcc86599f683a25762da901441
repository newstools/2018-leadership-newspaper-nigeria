More information as to how the upcoming national convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) will be conducted is coming to light as a member of the Media Subcommittee of the 2018 Convention of APC, Hon Abike Dabiri, has disclosed that 20 out of the 62 aspirants vying for various positions in the APC National Working Committee would be running unopposed, while 42 others would be going for outright election at the event scheduled for the Eagles Square in Abuja. She however dismissed insinuations that the party is drawing a unity list ahead of the event fixed for Saturday, saying any such list is fake. Hon Abike Dabiri made the disclosure shortly after the APC Convention Committee met with the various subcommittees last night to assess the preparation for the forthcoming national convention. She said, “The meeting today is about getting set for the convention which is going ahead as scheduled and is taking place at Eagles Square Abuja. Screening has been done; there are 20 positions that are going unopposed, so there’s 42 position to be contested. Some people were disqualified, for example if you are 40 years and going for national youth leader, you know you will be disqualified or you don’t have requisite educational qualification. “The bottom line is that this convention is going ahead. And we hear of the existence of a unity list, this is not true, there is no unity list. But of course consensus is allowed, affirmation is allowed. And of course as I said some people are running unopposed. There’s no such list as Unity list. The election will be free, fair and credible.” When pressed further to know details of those that have been disqualified, she said the Appeals Committee is still seating today on some of the cases. She explained further that talks are ongoing among contestants adding that there is still possibility of some of the candidates stepping for others in line with the constitution of the party.
