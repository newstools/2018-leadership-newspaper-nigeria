Former Rivers State commissioner for Commerce and Industry, Hon. Bright Jacob and two other prominent members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Oyigbo local government area of the state, yesterday dumped the party for the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC). This is as the lawmaker representing Ahoada-East constituency 1 in the Rivers State House of Assembly, Hon. Martyns Mannah, has said he dumped the PDP for the APC due to the refusal of the state government to approve any project for his constituency in the last three years. Jacob, who was recently dropped as commissioner in a minor cabinet reshuffle by governor Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, joined the APC along with a former lawmaker representing Oyigbo constituency in Rivers State House of Assembly, Hon. Nnamdi Ihute and two time chairman of Oyigbo local government council, Hon. Ibeawuchi Alex. Meanwhile, the lawmaker representing Ahoada-East constituency 1 in the Rivers State House of Assembly, Hon. Martyns Mannah, has said a lot of lawmakers in the House elected on the platform of the PDP were under oppression and would want to join the opposition APC. Mannah spoke at the weekend at Ahoada Civic Centre, Ahoada-Town, headquarters of Ahoada-East local government area of Rivers State, where he was received along with his over 3,000 supporters by the chairman of APC  in the state, Hon. Ojukaye Flag-Amachree. The lawmaker expressed worries that the state is being affected by being in opposition with the federal government in terms of development, stressing the need to align with the government at the centre. He said, “I came here to deliver a simple message and the message is that my people should accept change. Rivers State has never been in opposition and we don’t know how to play it. It does not benefit us, but we were deceived into it and we are seeing the result.”
