The International Labour Conference  (ILC) yesterday abrogated six conventions and withdrew three recommendations from its statutes. The conventions include the Inspection of Emigrants Convention, 1926 (No. 21); the Recruiting of Indigenous Workers Convention, 1936 (No. 50); the Contracts of Employment (Indigenous Workers) Convention, 1939 (No. 64); the Penal Sanctions (Indigenous Workers) Convention, 1939 (No. 65); the Contracts of Employment (Indigenous Workers) Convention, 1947 (No. 86) , and the Abolition of Penal Sanctions (Indigenous Workers) Convention, 1955 (No. 104). Recommendations include the Hours of Work (Fishing) Recommendation, 1920 (No. 7); the Migration for Employment Recommendation, 1939 (No. 61), and the Migration for Employment (Cooperation between States) Recommendation, 1939 (No. 62). Consequently, the ILO director-general will notify all members of the ILO as well as the secretary-general of the United Nations of this decision. Following the entry into force of an amendment to the ILO Constitution in 2015, only the International Labour Conference can abrogate an ILO convention in force – upon recommendation by the organisation’s governing body  – if it appears that it has lost its purpose or no longer makes a useful contribution towards attaining the objectives of the organisation. LEADERSHIP reports that a two-third majority of the ILC is required for such an abrogation.
