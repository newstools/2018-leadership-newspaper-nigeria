Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, has predicted that any gang-up against the reelection bid of Rivers State Governor, Chief Nyesom Ezenwo Wike in 2019 will fail woefully. This is as Wike yesterday roled out seven new roads in Amadi-Ama community in Port Harcourt City local government area of the state, saying the roads were constructed in fulfilment of promises made to the people of the area. Ekweremadu spoke yesterday while commissioning the Amadi-Ama internal roads as part of activities marking the third anniversary celebration of the Wike-led administration. The Deputy Senate President stated Wike will be re-elected on the premise of his performance, noting that for two weeks Rivers State has been in the news for positive reasons, as daily commissioning of great projects have taken over the airwaves. He said, “I can see the feeling of satisfaction on the faces  of the people. When you get the opportunity to serve, we must serve the people to the best of our ability. Governor Wike is serving  the good people of Rivers State. “By this time next  year, his mandate would have been  renewed by the people of Rivers State.  By  the time he concludes his second term, Rivers State would have been improved beyond expectations.” Speaking at the occasion, Wike said, “When we came here for our campaigns, the Amadi-Ama people promised to support us. They kept  their  own side of the bargain. These roads represent our commitment to the development of this community.” The governor thanked the Amadi-Ama people for their support for  the contractors to deliver the roads in line with approved specifications. He stated that the state government is using high level companies to construct projects in the area.
