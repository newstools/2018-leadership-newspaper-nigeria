Governors under the aegis of the Nigerian Governors Forum( NGF) are set to wade into the constant executive and legislature rift. This was one of the agendas of the meeting of the forum last night in Abuja.  Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari had accused the legislature of inserting strange projects into the 2018 budget. On their part, the lawmakers contended that the insertion was done to ensure even and balanced distribution of projects across the six geo- political zones in the country. The constant bickering between the two arms of government according to analyst have slowed down the pace of governance. The governors are set to constitute a committee to broker peace between the executive and legislature. Governors also met to review the minimum wage demands by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC). Some states are insisting that they cannot pay the proposed N66,500 proposed by the workers. Also the governors met with state’s Attorney Generals to resolve the contentious stamp duties impasse, which have been a subject of litigation.
