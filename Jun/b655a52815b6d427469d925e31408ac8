Justice Gabriel Kolawole of a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja yesterday sacked Senator Atai Idoko representing Kogi East Senatorial district on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party [PDP]. The court ordered the immediate swearing-in of Air Marshall Isaac Alfa (rtd.), who is also of the PDP, by the Clerk of the National Assembly as the authentic elected senator for the senatorial district. Justice Kolawole sacked Aidoko on the ground that he was not properly nominated by the PDP for the March 2015 National Assembly Elections. Consequently, the court ordered the Iindependent National electoral Commission [INEC], to immediately withdraw the certificate of return issued to Aidoko in 2015. In addition, the court ordered the clerk of the National Assembly to withdraw all privileges being accorded Aidoko. The National Assembly was also ordered to withdraw the recognition being accorded Aidoko on the grounds that he was not lawfully nominated and elected to the senatorial seat. Justice Kolawole, who condemned the ways and manner in which the PDP subverted the result of it primaries held that rogue documents were used by the PDP to submit Aidokoâ€™s name to INEC.
