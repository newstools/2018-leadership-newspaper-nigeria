Kano state Deputy Speaker, Alhaji Kabiru Alhassan Rurum has urged
Nigerians to face the challenges of nation building, calling on Muslim faithful to sustain the virtues of Ramadan. He reminded them of the cardinal message that although Eid-il-fitr
signified the end of Ramadan, “the doctrines of moderation, piety,
regular supplication to Allah (SWT), and being a brother’s keeper
subsist always beyond the Ramadan.” He urged Muslim faithful in the country to sustain the values and
virtues which the holy month of Ramadan taught them in their day-to-day relationship with God and fellow human beings. Rurum said: “I urge all Nigerians, across religious divide, to remain
steadfast, prayerful and patriotic . The virtues of moderation, piety,
regular supplication to Allah and being our brother’s keeper should
subsist beyond the Ramadan. “ He said the 30 days of fasting is a period for Muslim faithful to reflect on their behaviors and to make amends.
