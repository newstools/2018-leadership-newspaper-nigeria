A group known as Good-news Nigeria, has appealed to former heads of state, Generals Yakubu Gowon (rtd), Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (rtd), Abdulasalam Abubakar (rtd), and former minister of Defence, General TY Danjuma (rtd), and other northern leaders to persuade former military governor of Kaduna State, Colonel Dangiwa Umar (rtd) to run for President in 2019. The group believes that it is time for the Northern leaders to come out and pressure Dangiwa Umar to come out and seek for the number one office in the land so that he can save the country. The group had kick started a campaign to pressurise the former military governor to contest for the 2019 presidential election. The group in a statement by its national coordinator, Engr Dauda Mbaya,  stated  that they are mounting  pressure on him to run for the presidency and needs the support of more stakeholders. According to the group, Umar Dangiwa is the only credible and detribalised Nigerian with sound morals, who can take Nigeria to the Promised Land. It said northern leaders like Bishop Kukah, TY Danjuma, Alh. Bashir Tofa, Buba Galadima, Professor Ango Abdullahi, Ibrahim Commassie, Sheik Dahiru Bauchi, Cardinal John Onayikan, should support Umar. It added, that Northern leaders need to convince Dangiwa Umar to step out and contest because of his military background. According to the group, Dangiwa Umar sacrificed his military career to fight the injustice of June 12, 1993 and is one of the only few northern leaders that can be trusted by all religious and interest groups in the region and the country at large.
