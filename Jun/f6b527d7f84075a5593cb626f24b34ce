Former head of state, General Abdulsalami Abubakar (retd); the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Muhammadu Sanusi II, and the Etsu Nupe, Alhaji Yahaya Abubakar, have called on Nigerians to pray for the country to overcome its challenges. They made this appeal in their Sallah messages to Nigerians. Abdulsalami spoke to journalists on the importance of the Ramadan and the Eid celebration after prayers led by the chief Imam of Minna, Shiek Ibrahim Isa Fari, in company of the acting governor and Emir of Minna, Alhaji Umar Farouk Bahago. Abdulsalami called on Muslim faithful to ensure that the lesson of the fasting period was taken beyond the month of Ramadan. “I hope in Nigeria that peace reigns with us. All these problems we are going through – kidnapping and hostage taking – will come to an end,” he said, even as he urged Nigerians to be their brother’s keeper by maintaining peace. At Bida, after the Eid prayers led by the chief imam, Sheik Adamu Yakatu, the Etsu Nupe appealed to Muslims in the country to use the Sallah period to offer special prayers for peace, unity and commitment that would move Nigeria forward. “With fervent and continued prayers, God Almighty will assist the leaders to overcome any kind of challenge in the country,” he said. On his part, the Emir of Kano, Mallam Muhammadu Sanusi II, yesterday praised the federal government over what the monarch described as its determined fight against the menace of drug abuse in the country. The royal father, in his customary Eid el-Fitr spiritual remarks, commended the federal government for banning the importation of codeine into the country, remarking that the future of the nation was under threat from drug abuse. The monarch urged religious leaders to embark on rigorous campaign against drug abuse and to seek divine intervention in the fight against the menace. The emir also commended Kano State government for its campaign against the disturbing rate of the consumption of illicit and dangerous drugs in the state.
