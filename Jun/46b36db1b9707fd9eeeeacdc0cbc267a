The people of Offa in Kwara State, the scene of the bloody armed robbery attacks of April 5, this year, yesterday said that they did not agree that the Senate President, Dr Abubakar Bukola Saraki, had anything to do with the incident. This is just as coalition of Kwara youths under the aegis of Kwara Agenda, asked the federal government and the Nigeria Police to stop politicising the Offa robbery incident. Also, elders of Ajikobi Central Ward in the Ilorin West local government area of the state, where Saraki hails from said that they received with shock the invitation of the Senate President by the police in respect of the unfortunate Offa armed robbery attack. High Chief Bayo Akinola, who addressed newsmen in Offa yesterday on behalf of Olofa, Oba Mufutau Gbadamosi Esuwoye II, said that the community had left “what has happened to God, but we don’t want the innocent to be punished. We want police to go after the real culprits”. High Chief Akinola’s view was corroborated by the national general secretary of Offa Descendants Union (ODU), Chief Atinuke Wosilat McCarty. The elders of Ajikobi Central, in a statement signed by their coordinator, Alhaji Salihu AbdulWahab Agbaji, said that, “it is illogical and unthinkable that the Senate President and the political leader of Kwara State will ask bandits to kill the citizens that he leads. “’The plot against our son is as a result of his growing popularity across the country, a situation which is making some of his political rivals uncomfortable. We urge President Muhammadu Buhari to urgently call the Inspector General of Police to order so as to allow our hard earned democracy to blossom.”
