Some newly recruited staff of the National Pension Commission (PENCOM), whose assumption of duty was put on hold by the Commission since May 2017 have petitioned the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, asking him to intervene in their case. The group in a letter signed by Mustapha Sadiq and Ismail Gazali dated March 8, 2018, on behalf of others, said: “We write this letter as a group humbly seeking your kind intervention in the delay of our assumption of duty. Following the completion of an aptitude test and interview conducted in December 2016/January 2017, we were issued letters of employment by PENCOM, after which we signed and submitted acceptance letters with the commission accordingly. “As stated in our appointment letters, we were to assume duty on May 2nd and June 5th, 2017, respectively.  However, prior to our date of resumption, we were informed via telephone calls of indefinite postponement of our assumption of duty, a dilemma we have remained in till date, despite the fact that majority of us had resigned from our previous places of employment. “We will like to appeal to you as a father to use your good offices and kindly intervene on our behalf to bring an end to our plight as life has been very unbearable.” In a reply dated April 4, 2018 referenced as 56331/S.3/C2/I/T/99, the Office of the SGF said, “a response from the Commission stated that the decision was based on the need to allow for a review of the earlier recruitment exercise(s) to: ensure compliance with Extant Laws and due process; recruitment within approved manpower establishment; and provide required infrastructure to accommodate new appointees.” However, a source said if the last batch of appointment, which went through due process, was defective, then the two previous batches of appointments, which went through the same due process must be defective then. According to the source, the current management of the Commission had not written to inform the newly employed but only  called them on phone.
