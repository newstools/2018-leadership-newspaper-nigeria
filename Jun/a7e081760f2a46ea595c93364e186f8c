The Youth wing of Mumuye Cultural Development Association yesterday, kicked against the jail sentence of former Taraba State governor, Rev Jolly Nyame, who has been sentenced to 14 years imprisonment by the Federal High Court Abuja. At a press conference in Jalingo, president of the association, Mr Danladi Hassan, said the judgment was characterised with political undertone. While expressing dissatisfaction over the judgment, Hassan said there were no enough evidence before the court to warrant the obnoxious judgment that convicted Nyame for the offences he was standing trial for. “We acknowledge the role of the judiciary as an arm of government, but we want the public to know that the said judgment is unreasonable and unwarranted and cannot be relied upon. “The judgment lacks qualities of a valid and sound moral judgment. It is characterised with some political undertone and we reject the judgment. “While we call on the people of Taraba and friends of the former governor to remain calm, we urged the former Governor to appeal the judgment where we believe, he will get justice. “We demand justice and fairness to all manner of people regardless of their tribe and religion and we reject the selective justice that negates the true and real concept of justice,” he said. The group wondered why the judge slammed 14 years jail term on the former governor without an option of fine, adding that it was aimed at tarnishing the political future of the former governor.
