Meanwhile, the PDP caucus in the House of Representatives yesterday urged President Muhammadu Buhari to adopt the strategy deployed to neutralise uprising caused by Indigenous People of biafra (IPOB) in dealing with the marauding killer herdsmen. The PDP lawmakers also applauded the government of the United States of America for condemning in strong terms the latest attack in Plateau state, which claimed more than 100 lives. According to the PDP House caucus, many Nigerians are worried that a government that had taken very urgent and comprehensive action to neutralize IPOB, which had not killed, currently finds its very difficult to tackle criminal herdsmen who have been attacking people in Benue, Zamfara, Taraba and other states. The PDP caucus, in a statement signed by the deputy Minority Leader of the House, Hon Chukwuma Wilfred Onyema, expressed deep shock over the barbaric killing of little children in violent attacks largely suspected to be retaliatory action over loss of cows. While expressing sympathy with the victims of the recent violent attacks in Plateau State, the PDP House caucus said it has become extremely worrisome that the APC-led federal government is unable to tame the heinous crime. “Against the background of the APC federal government’s unending rhetoric and deliberate ineffectiveness, unending criminality and free flow of human blood continue across the nation, as a result of emboldened herdsmen and incessant bloody campaigns,” Onyeama stated. The PDP caucus also condemned the actions of the security personnel attached to the presidential villa who allegedly assaulted a leader of the Bring Back Our Girls Movement (BBOG) and former Minister of Education, Mrs Oby Ezekwesili. “It calls for concern that Oby Ezekwesili, the co-convener of the BBOG movement ran into trouble after she began a loud solo protest with her demands for action from the Presidency, as she asked for explanations that normally agitate the minds of many Nigerians,” the statement further noted.
