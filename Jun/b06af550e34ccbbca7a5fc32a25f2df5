Since the African Queen crooner 2Baba and his long time girlfriend, Annie Idibia, got married it has been love all the way. Many wouldn’t have believed that a Casanova like 2face who is known to be free with women would eventually settle down with a single woman as his wife. Even at some of his shows, the artiste has declared that he is now a faithful husband and ” I no dey do that kind thing again, I love my wife.” 2Baba and his wife, Annie, created a scene on Instagram with their chat about the singer’s love for women. But a twist of event maybe trying to pull the legs of his wife, 2Baba made a post on Instagram, declaring his love for women and how unashamed he is to say it. His declaration was certain to attract the interest of his wife, Annie, who many have lauded for her decision to settle down with the singer even after dealing with his philandering habit during their pre-marriage relationship. Surprisingly, when Annie would make a reaction to 2Baba’s post, she only dropped identical ‘eye-rolling’ smileys. The smiley suggests that the lovers are only engaging in banter.
