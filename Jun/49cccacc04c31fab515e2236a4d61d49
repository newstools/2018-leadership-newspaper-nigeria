Cesc Fabregas has played down the contribution of Cristiano Ronaldo at the World Cup and said that Argentina’s struggles are not all Lionel Messi’s fault. Writing in a column for BBC Sport, Fabregas, who was left out of Spain’s squad for this summer’s tournament, said that Ronaldo’s four goals in two games, including a hat trick against La Roja, “have come from set-pieces, penalties or mistakes.” Fabregas also praised former Barcelona teammate Messi and bemoaned Argentina’s lack of quality as they have drawn with Iceland and lost to Croatia putting them on the brink of an early World Cup exit. “It was a similar story for Messi against Croatia, but it was not all his fault,” Fabregas said. “As I said in my TV analysis after Argentina’s defeat, they look like a broken team. “So it is has been really difficult for him. He does not have the quality in behind him, when he needs someone who can help him build up the play.
