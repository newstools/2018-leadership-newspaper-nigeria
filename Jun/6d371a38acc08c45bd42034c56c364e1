The death toll from twin blasts on a mosque in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, has risen to at least 16 people, and the number of wounded to 35, security officials who wished to remain anonymous, said. Wednesday’s attack on the predominantly Shia Sadr City district caused damage to nearby buildings, the officials said. The mosque is frequented by supporters of Shia cleric Muqtada’s al-Sadr whose Sairoon coalition won a plurality of seats, 54 in total, in the last month’s parliamentary elections.A statement issued by the Iraqi government said the explosion, which ripped through the mosque, took place at a weapons warehouse in Sadr city. The government noted it was still investigating the incident. Earlier in the day, Iraq’s parliament voted in favour of a full recount of some 11 million ballots cast in the May 12 vote. Members of parliament also sacked a nine-member independent electoral commission that oversaw the process and replaced the body with judges.
