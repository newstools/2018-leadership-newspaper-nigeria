Fresh facts have emerged that the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo and National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) will on Tuesday attend the mega campaign rally to woo voter for the party’s governorship candidate, Dr. Kayode Fayemi ahead of the July 14 poll.  The Director of Media and Publicity of the Kayode Fayemi Campaign Organisation, Wole Olujobi who revealed this on Sunday said the chairman of the APC National Campaign Committee for the election, who is also the Kebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu will also attend the rally where the party’s flag will be handed over to Fayemi and his deputy. According to the statement, ‘’the Peoples Democratic Party is planning to stoke violence at the rally using “fake APC members. “We are aware of moves to instigate some segments of the society against Dr Kayode Fayemi to cause disaffection between him and large populations of Ekiti people, particularly workers, all in an attempt to orchestrate a deep-seated resentment against the APC candidate.  “We are also aware of moves to set up fake fifth columnists to act as saboteurs to APC’s electioneering activities, including using fake APC members to stoke violence to disrupt June 19, 2018 mega rally at the Kayode Oluyemi Stadium in Ado-Ekiti to be led by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo where Fayemi and his deputy, will officially receive APC’s flag to contest the July 14 poll. “The trend started last week when thugs bearing guns stormed Ado-Ikere road in the night to destroy Fayemi’s campaign billboard in front of the hotel of former APC governorship aspirant, Dr Wole Oluyede, including threatening the owner for supporting Fayemi and not Prof Olusola Eleka of PDP only to be followed in the night of same day with the murder of APC supporter in Ado-Ekiti. “We hereby remind trouble-makers that this is not 2014 when they had a field day killing, maiming and unleashing mayhem on the opposition. “The security agencies are more than ready to live up to their responsibilities and we advise trouble-makers working for the state government to go on holiday from now till the end of the election because anyone caught causing crisis will have a date with the security agencies for appropriate sanctions.”
