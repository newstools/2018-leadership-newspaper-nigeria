The All Progressives Congress (APC) Women Leader, Hajiya Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu, has called for the support of all Nigerians, especially the women, in her quest to contest for another term in the upcoming APC National Convention, which has been slated for this Saturday, 23 June, 2018. Hajiya Aliyu made the call recently after undergoing her screening exercise for aspirants by the Screening Committee of the party ahead of the convention, which she passed successfully. The exercise is mandatory for those who want to contest for any national post in the APC convention. “Women have been relegated to the background too much and this must stop henceforth, and I intend to do this by changing the orientation of our women. She is a special person whose responsibility, is to raise nations, which is why I am soliciting for all your support in the upcoming election, so that we can have the opportunity to achieve much more than we did in the past together,” she said. She went on to mention her seven-point agenda for the position of the All Progressives Congress (APC) national women leader, 2018, which include, mobilising support for APC women in local elections across the federation; raising the level of awareness within and outside the APC leadership of the capacity of APC women; massively mobilising Nigerian women from all walks of life to vote for APC across all levels of government; capacity building for APC women; devising strategic and creative ways of funding APC women programmes to ensure a more inclusive and vibrant APC women wing; advocacy for social inclusion and empowerment of women; ensuring a more united and progressive APC women wing.
