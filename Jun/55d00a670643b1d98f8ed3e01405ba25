The leader of the new Peoples Democratic Party(nPDP) block of the All Progressives Congress( APC), Alh Abubakar Kawu Baraje said his group will continue with its agitations even after the party’s national convention. ‘We want to appreciate the entire Nigerians and our supporters and we want to let them know that our struggle is still on course and until the party addresses some the major areas of concerns that will make live easy for Nigerians we remain undaunted”, Baraje said in a statement from his media office. He clarified that they decided to attend yesterday’s  convention of APC because ‘they want to demonstrate to the world and entire Nigerians and particularly to their supporters that they are loyal to the party.” He added that their attendance of the APC convention “does not mean that all the group’s grievances stated in their letter had been addressed. We still believe that our loyalty should be demonstrated, that was why we attended the convention “. Baraje noted that the convention was done “despite the fact that there are so many litigations in the court against the party arising from parallel congresses in over 18 states of the federation . The statement reads in part: “The fact that we were able to attend the APC convention and the convention is going on well is not an interpretation that the suffering of the masses had been alleviated and is not an answer that the security in the country which has been seriously jeopardised is being addressed. It is not a pointer to the fact that youth unemployment and human capital development are been addressed.” The nPDP leader said these are all the groups concern and warned that even if the APC convention went on smoothly, it is not yet uhuru because “ the foundation of the convention is shaky as there are so many aggrieved party members and stakeholders and the party is aware of this.”
