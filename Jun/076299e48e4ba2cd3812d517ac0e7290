A two time former federal Minister, Chief Femi Fani-Kayode, has alleged that besides former president Olusegun Obasanjo, former military president, Ibrahim Babangida, immediate past President Goodluck Jonathan and former minister of defence, Gen TY Danjuma are also on the target list of the federal government. Fani-Kayode who was a minister of culture and tourism, also added that some other persons opposed to the present administration have been alleged listed to be given the treatment meted to former national security adviser, Col Sambo Dasuki. The former Minister of Aviation stated this in a statement while reacting to Obasanjo’s claim that the Buhari administration wants to arrest and detain him on trumped up charges. He however warned that threatening the lives of the former leaders will have consequence. “The government are also planning to target other key opposition figures and elder statesmem as we get closer to 2019 such as General T.Y. Danjuma, General Ibrahim Babangida, President Goodluck Jonathan and a handful of others. “It appears that Buhari will stop at nothing in order to ensure that all his critics are silenced”.
