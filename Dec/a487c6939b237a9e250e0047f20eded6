The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has warned media houses to desist from misinforming the general public on the circumstances surrounding the death of former Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh. A statement by the Director of Information and Public Relations Air Commodore Ibkunle Daramola said the NAF has observed some erroneous reports stating that the driver of the late former CDS, who was also shot during the incident, is dead while other allege that adequate security was not provided for the deceased Air Chief Marshal. He said such reports are far from the truth and should be discontinued. He explained that contrary to the reports, the driver is alive and recuperating extremely well at one of our NAF Hospitals. He also noted that Air Chief Marshal Badeh has always been provided with the full complement of personal staff and security personnel commensurate with his status as a former Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), CDS and a 4-star general in the Armed Forces of Nigeria. “The NAF wishes to state categorically that nothing could be further from the truth. Firstly, all are please requested to note that the driver is alive and recuperating extremely well at one of our NAF Hospitals. “Secondly, Air Chief Marshal Badeh has always been provided with the full complement of personal staff and security personnel commensurate with his status as a former Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), CDS and a 4-star general in the Armed Forces of Nigeria,” he said He reiterated that the NAF is working closely with other relevant security agencies to determine the circumstances surrounding the death of the former CDS with a view to ensuring that the perpetrators of the heinous act are brought to justice. He further disclosed that substantial progress has already been made in the ongoing investigation and details would be communicated at the appropriate time. “While appreciating the overwhelming show of support received from well-meaning Nigerians during this trying time, the NAF wishes to request that the spreading of misinformation about the incident should stop forthwith as this could have adverse effects on the conduct of ongoing operations,” he said
