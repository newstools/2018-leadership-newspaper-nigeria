Gospel musician, Donnie McClurkin has confirmed in a Facebook post that he nearly died in a fatal accident yesterday. According to him, he was saved by two angels when he lost consciousness whiles driving. Some of his fans urged him to hire a chauffeur since he means more than a musician to them. He wrote, “Was in a serious accident at 12:50 am this morning…passed out while driving on the highway. Totaled the car…hospitalized, going through a myriad of tests…..But I’m alive!!! “Lost consciousness driving…but two human angels followed my swerving car with their emergency blinkers onto stop traffic ….drove behind me until my car crashed into the middle concrete island. I remember none of it except those two angels pulling me out of the passengers side of the crumbled TOTALED car..airbags deployed…crushed metal and Fiberglas!!.” “I AM ALIVE!!!! Somewhat mangled, stitches on left thumb, sprained wrist, hurt knee, but I’m still here! God and two angels saved my life! I owe them… I am still here by the grace of God! Thank you, Lord…thank you!.” In another post showing the damaged car, he said: “This is the totaled car that two angels rescued me from ….after passing out while driving I don’t remember most of what happened a day and a half ago…but God! “I override doctors and sisters advice and flew to KENYA today for ministry Saturday @ TWO RIVERS. and home on this Sunday to celebrate life” “My new Christmas single “MY FAVORITE THINGS” has one more thing added to the list….LIFE! “I’m hurting and limping (a little) but I’m STILL HERE!!!
