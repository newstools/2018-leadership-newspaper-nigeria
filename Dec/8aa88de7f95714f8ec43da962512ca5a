President Muhammadu Buhari hinted yesterday that the federal government will institute a suitable memorial to immortalise the country’s first executive president, Alhaji Shehu Shagari, who passed away on Friday. Buhari made the promise in Sokoto when he paid a condolence visit to the Shagari family. In a letter to the Sokoto State governor, Alhaji Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, read by the governor at the event, the president stated: “I received the very sad news of the passing away of Alhaji Shehu Usman Aliyu Shagari, former President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “This, indeed, is a grievous loss, which will be felt throughout Nigeria, irrespective of any difference. The late Alhaji Shagari was a landmark figure being virtually our last link to the post-independence government of Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa , and the first elected Executive President of Nigeria. “Please convey to his immediate family, the government and the people of Sokoto State my heartfelt condolences on the passing away of this great statesman. The Federal Government will in due course institute a suitable memorial to the late former President. May his soul rest in peace.” Buhari was received at the Sultan Abubakar III International Airport by both Sokoto and Kebbi State governors, Aminu Tambuwal and Senator Atiku Bagudu respectively. Also present to welcome the president were the chairman, Northern Senators’ Forum, Senator Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko; former Governor Attahiru Dalhatu Bafarawa, former Minister of Transport, Yusuf Suleiman and Sokoto state APC gubernatorial candidate, Ahmed Aliyu Sokoto. From the airport, President Muhammadu Buhari proceeded to the residence of the late Shagari at Sama Road within Sokoto metropolis and was received by Alhaji Bala Shagari who is the Marafan Shagari and the eldest son of the late former president. Responding on behalf of the bereaved family, after the president’s letter was read, Bala Shagari thanked Buhari for the visit.
