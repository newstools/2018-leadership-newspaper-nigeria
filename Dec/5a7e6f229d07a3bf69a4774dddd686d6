Another meeting between the Federal government and the striking Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has  again ended without both parties resolving their issues. The meeting which was held yesterday at the ministry of education ended with no solution in sight to the end of the strike action embarked by ASUU since November 5. Speaking with journalists after meeting, the National President of ASUU, Prof Biodun Ogunyemi, said both parties are yet to reach a concrete decision. “For now, we have started to discuss, we are yet to reach any concrete decision. Once we have more information, we will make ourselves available to the press,” he said. Since the lecturers resumed strike on November 5, 2018, over demands for improved funding of public universities based on agreements reached with the Federal Government in 2009, the two bodies have met about four times with the aim of bringing a lasting solution to the problem.
