Kogi State government has disclosed that the state governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, handed over to the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Hon. Matthew Kolawole, to act on his behalf before departing the country with President Muhammadu Buhari for the Climate Change Summit in Poland. The director general, Media and Publicity to the governor, Kingsley Fanwo, who disclosed this in Lokoja while fielding questions from Assembly correspondents said the governor did what is “necessary of him to keep the administration of the state going”. Fanwo stated: “Rt Hon. Matthew Kolawole is the Acting Governor of the State. He has been overseeing the affairs of the state since the departure of Governor Yahaya Bello to Poland. “As you can see, I have come to take briefs from him. He is someone who believes in the political leadership of Governor Bello and the New Direction Blueprint of the administration”. When asked about the whereabouts of the deputy governor, Fanwo told journalists to confirm that from the media handlers of the deputy governor. “The deputy governor has people who speak for him. They will confirm to you that the deputy governor is currently on annual leave as we speak. The governor has the powers to hand over to the speaker since the deputy governor has gone on leave. He has not violated any law. “The speaker is grateful to the governor for the confidence reposed in him and has pledged his unalloyed commitment to the success of the administration. What is happening in Kogi State is a perfect symbiosis in governance and the people are reaping the fruits of the cooperation between the executive and the legislature as we are witnessing in this dispensation”.
