The Ogun governorship candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC) in the forthcoming general elections, Prince Dapo Abiodun has expressed optimism that the internal crisis rocking the state chapter of the party will be resolved before the election. Abiodun also expressed the confidence that the incumbent state governor, Ibikunle Amosun would not only come to reality with his candidature as APC governorship candidate for the state, but also lead the campaign for his election. The APC governorship candidate, who spoke with journalists yesterday in Iperu Remo during official unveiling of his deputy, Engineer Noimot Salako Oyedele maintained that Amosun will kick start the APC campaign in the state and use the occasion to raise his hand up as the authentic APC governorship candidate for Ogun state in the coming general elections. Fielding questions from journalists regarding the position of the outgoing governor, who has on many occasions declared that he would not neither recognise, nor support the candidature of Dapo Abiodun in the forthcoming governorship election in the state, Abiodun explained that Amosun would attend the flag off of his governorship campaign when the time comes. He explained that the state leadership of the party still has about 77 days from now to the election to resolve whatever crisis that is still be-deviling the party from approaching the election as one united political family.
