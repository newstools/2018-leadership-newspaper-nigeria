A former gubernatorial aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Gombe State, Alhaji Farouk Bamusa, has expressed confidence that President Mohammadu Buhari will not only secure reelection in 2019 but will humiliate the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Atiku Abubakar, in his North East geopolitical zone. Bamusa, disclosed this at the weekend in a chat with journalists in Gombe. Bamusa did not mince words as he stated that Atiku will not only be defeated in Bauchi, Gombe, Taraba, Yobe and Borno States alone but even in Adamawa, his home state. “Don’t be deceive by the stories you hear or things you read on social media, we are the ones on ground and we are the ones controlling the votes, we know the feelings of our electorates, our people are with the APC and with President Mohammadu Buhari, it is based on this that I can confidently tell you that the PDP and its candidates will suffer humiliation in 2019, just watch out. “We have a good basis to compare the two of them, while Atiku was Vice President the only road that link to his hometown from Yola, he was not able to do, there was no single tangible thing that you can point to the vice presidency of Atiku as a benefit to the people of the North East. Buhari has done 100 times better for the zone than Atiku has done.” He noted that the people of the zone suffered untold hardship under the PDP for many years due to security challenges. “North East was the hot bed of Boko Haram and insecurity during the advent of the PDP administration but things are now better, so voting for the PDP is like going back to Egypt for the Israelites.” According to him the emergence of APC under the leadership of President Buhari was divine and the saving grace of the area. He then urged the people of the zone to take their destiny into their hand by ensuring the reelection of PMB.
