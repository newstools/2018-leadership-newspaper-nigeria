The Nigerian Army has accused Amnesty International office in Nigeria of destabilisation plot and called for its closure. In a statement issued yesterday in Abuja by the Director Army Public Relations, Brig-Gen. Sani Usman, declared that Amnesty International had deviated from its “core values, principles and objectives.” According to him, “the Nigerian branch of Amnesty International that has hitherto been well respected has deviated from the core values, principles and objectives of the original Amnesty International domiciled in the United Kingdom (UK). “There is credible information that the Nigerian branch of the international non-governmental organisation is determined to destabilise the Nigerian nation,” he said, adding that “mischief is executed via fabrication of fictitious allegations of alleged human rights abuses against the Nigerian security forces and clandestine sponsorship of dissident groups to protest against the leadership of the Nigerian military.” Usman noted that Amnesty International Nigeria had over the years being using Boko Haram terrorists’ conflicts, Islamic Movement in Nigeria (Shi’ite group), some activists and now herders-farmers’ conflicts to carry out its illegalities in the country. He continued: “The Nigerian Army has no option than to call for the closure of Amnesty International offices in Nigeria, if such recklessness continues. Consequently, Nigerians should be wary of Amnesty International (Nigeria) because its goals are to destabilise Nigeria and to dismember it.” Amnesty International Role In Terrorism War Worries Presidency Also yesterday, the presidency expressed concern about the role Amnesty International is playing in the war against terror in Nigeria. <img class="size-medium wp-image-77363 alignleft" src="https://i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1532399070_Amnesty-International.png?resize=300%2C225&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1532399070_Amnesty-International.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1532399070_Amnesty-International.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1532399070_Amnesty-International.png?resize=533%2C400&amp;ssl=1 533w, https://i0.wp.com/leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1532399070_Amnesty-International.png?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" />The presidency in a statement made public by the senior special assistant on media to the president, Garba Shehu, said that while President Muhammadu Buhari cherishes and encourages the noble ideals on which institutions such as Amnesty International are founded, the organisation’s operations in Nigeria seem geared towards damaging the morale of the Nigerian military. He said that it often appears as if the government is fighting two wars on terror: against Boko Haram and against Amnesty International. Shehu said: “The obvious bias and inaccuracies in Amnesty International’s recent country reports on Nigeria risk Amnesty’s reputation as an impartial international organisation. “President Buhari appeals to the leadership of Amnesty International to scrutinise its advocacy in Nigeria, especially as it relates to the war against terrorism,” he said.
