The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has revealed that the migration of the ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) to the Treasury Single Account (TSA) has led to positive growth in the value and volume of transactions recorded in end to end payments in 2017. The apex bank made the disclosure in its 2017 annual activity report released by its Banking and Payments System Department on its Website. It also attributed the growth to the rise in the number of MDAs accounts migrated to the TSA. The CBN said the value of transactions recorded in the period under review stood at N13.53 trillion from the N10.65 trillion in 2016, representing an increase of 27.01 per cent. The apex bank also said volume of transaction grew with an increase of 3.84 per cent to record 39.7 million in 2017 as against the 38.24 million recorded in 2016. According to the CBN, the payment instructions comprise recurrent, overhead and capital expenditure. On the TSA implementation, the bank added that during the year, stakeholders’ engagements took place to improve the operations and address some of the challenges facing it. The apex bank noted: “In order to engender healthy competition and ensure effective service delivery, the federal government’s TSA payment gateway model was modified to accommodate other service providers. “The aggregator model was developed to bring in more players into the e-collection process, thereby providing a level playing ground for all the Payments Service Providers (PSPs), with NIBSS as the aggregator. “The initiative was driven by the Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF) with the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation (OAGF) as the implementing agency, in collaboration with the Central Bank of Nigeria.”
