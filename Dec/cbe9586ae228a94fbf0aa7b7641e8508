Chairman of the Senate Committee on Petroleum (Downstream), Senator Kabiru Garba Marafa CON (APC, Zamfara Central) has vowed to remain in the All Progressives Congress (APC) to support President Muhammadu Buhari and coordinate his 2019 re-election bid. In a statement signed by Senator Marafa himself in Abuja over the weekend, he said he remained unperturbed by the fact that the Independent National Electoral Commission’s (INEC) deadline for the substitution of governorship candidates, which ended this weekend, has endangered his gubernatorial ambition. He said regardless of shenanigans, intrigue or injustice meted on him, he would remain in the APC to support and lead President Buhari’s 2019 re-election campaign in Zamfara State and to ensure that Governor Yari fails woefully in his attempts to perpetrate injustice and impose his moles as candidates of the party in the state. Marafa, however, thanked the people of the state for their maximum support and cooperation with him, saying his decision to remain in the APC, despite all pressures was in appreciation of their tremendous support and in their best interest. This is just as he commended the national chairman of the APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, for respecting the court order, supporting the masses’ choice of direct primaries and ignoring pressures from a failed governor. He challenged Governor Yari to go to another party with all his anointed candidates and contest if he believes he is popular. According to Senator Marafa, he said, ’’Recall that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had earlier banned the APC from submitting candidates for Governorship, National and State Assembly following the party’s inability to conduct primaries and consensus in Zamfara State. “As a leading governorship aspirant in Zamfara State, as well as a founding member of the APC and a close confidant of President Buhari, I will remain in the APC, even when my ambition is being threatened.
