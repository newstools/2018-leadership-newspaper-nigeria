The Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ike Ekweremadu (PDP, Enugu), yesterday disagreed with the Senate Majority Leader, Senator Ahmed Lawan (APC, Yobe), over the composition of the membership of the Red Chamber. LEADERSHIP Friday reports that the open disagreement happened on the floor of the Senate at plenary presided over by Ekweremadu. Raising a point of order, Lawan had claimed that there were 56 APC senators as against PDP’s 46 senators in the upper legislative chamber. But Ekweremadu countered him, saying there was no record to back his claim. Lawan’s point of order was in reaction to two newspaper reports (not LEADERSHIP Friday) of Wednesday, December 12, 2018 relating to the party composition of the Senate and a ruling by Ekweremadu at plenary of the previous day, which he dismissed as errorneous. “On page 5 of Daily Trust of Wednesday, December 12, 2018, it is reported that the APC senators are 57 and PDP senators (are) 58. “For the record, Mr President, APC senators are 56 and PDP senators are 46. “On page 7, the Daily Trust reported that when a question was put for the confirmation of Festus Keyamo for NDIC governing board, the nays had it, but that you said the ayes had it,” Lawan said.
