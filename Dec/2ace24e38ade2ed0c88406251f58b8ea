The helicopter crash that killed Leicester City owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha in October was caused by a faulty mechanism in the helicopter’s tail rotor mechanism, causing the pilot to lose control of the aircraft, British investigators said. Srivaddhanaprabha, 60, was one of five people on board the aircraft when it burst into flames after crashing in a parking lot next to King Power Stadium, where the team plays its home games. No one on board survived. In a report published Thursday, investigators announced they believed based on evidence recovered from the crash that the pilot lost control of the right yaw function of the helicopter after a piece of the tail rotor control mechanism became disconnected. The report made no mention of foul play and said authorities are still probing the “initiating cause and exact sequence of the failure that resulted in the loss of tail rotor control.”
