The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC has filed a ten-court charge of laundering N14bn belonging to the Akwa Ibom State government against the President of the Nigerian Bar Association, Paul Usoro (SAN) before the Federal High Court in Lagos. The president of the NBA is expected to be arraigned before Justice Muslim Hassan on Monday December 10, 2018 for the alleged offence. According to the charge, marked FHC/418c/18 obtained by our correspondent, the EFCC claimed that Usoro converted and laundered the money in connivance with the governor of his state, Governor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State. Although the name of the governor was not listed as a defendant but his name was mentioned in the body charge but the anti-graft agency indicated that he is “currently constitutionally immuned against criminal prosecution”.

The anti-graft agency alleged that the NBA President in connivance with the others mentioned in the charge conspired among themselves to commit the offence sometime in 2015 “within the jurisdiction of this honourable court”. The EFCC maintained that the N14bn allegedly converted and laundered by the defendants belonged to the Akwa Ibom State Government.
