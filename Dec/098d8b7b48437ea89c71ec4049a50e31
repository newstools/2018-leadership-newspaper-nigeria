Elders of Okada community, headquarters of Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo, have mandated its people to vote enmass for candidates of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2019 general elections. The  mandate was handed down to the people during a  meeting took placed at the community hall at Okada, near Benin on Wednesday. The meeting was also used to endorse the APC candidate for the Ovia Federal Constituency, Mr Dennis Idahosa. The Odionwere (Village head) of Okada, Mr Napoleon Imude, said their endorsement of Idahosa was because they needed a “strong voice” in the National Assembly. To ensure that the mandate was carried out, the community placed a curse on any of its indigenes who votes against the APC and its candidates in the elections. Omosede Igbinedion who is the incumbent lawmaker representing Ovia in the National Assembly, hails from Okada. Imude prayed for Idahosa to succeed at the polls, warned the villagers not to deviate from supporting the APC. According to him, “We have heard about you Idahosa for a long time. You are bringing something good. All Okada men and women should hear and we pray God will make him (You) to win.” Idahosa assured the Okada elders that the community would be developed if the APC is victorious at the polls. He promised to attract dividends of democracy to the community. Speaking in a chat with newsmen, Idahosa explained that the reasons for the endorsement were for him to fulfill three things. “One of them is for me to be active in the House to be able to attract a lot of development to the Constituency. “The second is to concentrate on human capital development and to be accessible to the electorate. “My opponents failed woefully in all those issues. She is not accessible. She is not around when important issues are being discussed during plenary “I could sense that Okada people are fed up and made up their mind to vote her out of office. They found the messiah they needed in me.”
