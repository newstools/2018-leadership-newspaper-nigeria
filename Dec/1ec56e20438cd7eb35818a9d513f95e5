The Nigeria Police Force has reportedly arrested two key suspects and three others in connection with the killing of the former chief of defence staff (CDS), Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh (rtd). LEADERSHIP recalls that the former CDS was killed in the evening of December 18, 2018 while returning from his farm along the Abuja-Keffi highway. The murder, which raised a lot of concern about the security situation in the country, occurred after Badeh’s Toyota Tundra truck was riddled with the killers’ bullets, leaving only him dead out of the three occupants of the vehicle. While Badeh’s driver sustained bullet wounds, a friend of the former CDS was kidnapped by the assailants. Three days ago, the latter was reportedly released after the family paid ransom. A very reliable source in the police told LEADERSHIP that two principal suspects believed to have masterminded Badeh’s killing and three others have been arrested. However, all attempts to get a confirmation of the arrests from the Force Public Relations Officer, DCP Moshood Jimoh, were unsuccessful, but a police source told our correspondent that the suspects would be paraded at any moment from now. “We have made a breakthrough in the case and we have arrested suspects who will be paraded,” the source said.
