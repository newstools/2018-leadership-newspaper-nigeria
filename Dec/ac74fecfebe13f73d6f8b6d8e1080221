The Department of State Services released CSP Sani Mohammed Baba-Inna, ADC to the First Lady and Wife of the President, Hajiya Aisha Buhari. Spokesperson of the DSS, Afunanya Peter, in a statement noted that Baba-Inna was handed over to the Police for further administrative action. It would be recalled that Baba-Inna was, on 22nd of September, 2018, handed to the Service by the Police authorities for detailed investigations into accusations of collecting about N2.5 billion on behalf of the first lady and pocketing the money. He had been accused of defamation of character and unduly using his office and that of the first lady to fraudulently extort and obtain money from sources. He was alleged to have carried out the illegal and other unethical activities in the name of the first lady on whose behalf he falsely claimed to have acted. Investigation, however, disclosed that he was never, at any given time or circumstance, directly or indirectly, instructed, by the first lady, to act or collect, in her name, money or material gifts from any person(s) or group(s). The DSS noted that “in line with standard procedures expected in handling a matter of this nature, Baba-Inna is returned to the Police for appropriate regimental action. Accordingly, the details of the investigation report have also been forwarded to the relevant authorities.”
