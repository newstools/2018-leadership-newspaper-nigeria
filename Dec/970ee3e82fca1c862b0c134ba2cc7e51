The committee set up to investigate allegations of fraud levelled against the executive secretary of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), Prof Usman Yusuf, will today submit its report to the secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha. Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari, in October had approved that the NHIS Boss, Prof Yusuf, should proceed on administrative leave immediately. In his absence, Mr Ben Omogo, a director of Administration in the Office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation has been deployed to oversee the affairs of the Scheme. President Buhari had also approved the establishment of an independent fact-finding panel to investigate the alleged infractions by Prof Usman. LEADERSHIP recalls that the NHIS boss had been under investigation for several allegations of fraud. He was among others accused of perpetrating fraud to the tune of N919m and was suspended by the minister of Health in July last year. However, he was reinstated by President Buhari in February 2018 but was again suspended by the governing council of the NHIS on October 19.
