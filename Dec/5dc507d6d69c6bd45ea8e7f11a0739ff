The Youth Leader of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Kaduna State chapter Hon Aliyu Bello has said that the crowd that attended it’s North Central presidential rally was not rented. According to Aliyu, the allegations made by an APC Northwest governor should be disregarded. In a statement he personally signed, Aliyu said the unprecedented mammoth crowd in the history of Sokoto State made up mainly of PDP members and APC turncoats. He said the crowd sent fear to some Northwest governors who are already jittery over what might befall them in the coming months. “We are sure of our victory come 2019 and the state that the PDP is most sure of taking back is Kaduna state. Because  Kaduna state under the watch of el-Rufai’s APC has not only become the most backward in northern Nigeria in terms of ruinous infrastructure,  it has most  despondent citizenry and is the most unsafe place to live in Nigeria compared to where the PDP conceded power to the APC in 2015,” Aliyu said in the statement.
