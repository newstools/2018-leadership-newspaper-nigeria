The Baro River Port Cargo handling equipment installation has been completed and ready for commissioning, LEADERSHIP can report. The Baro River Port in Niger State was awarded in 2011 at a cost of N2,563,499,248.00 by the Federal Executive Council to Messrs CGGC Global Projects Limited The project has been completed but abandoned and left in ruins before the current management resuscitated and turned it into use. Managing director/CEO of NIWA, Senator (Dr.) Adeleke Olorunnimbe Mamora speaking at the weekend after he visited the Baro River Port to ascertain the level of work done so far, said the River Port cargo handling equipment would soon start operation. Mamora, who was impressed by what he saw while the contractors were fixing the last equipment, was given assurance by the contractors that the project will be ready in in the next one week or two. Mamora also commended the contractors for a job well done and the community for being a good host and encouraged them to ensure the safety and security of the River Port. He said Baro River Port, which is the flagship port in the northern part of the country, will be commissioned very soon by President Muhammadu Buhari. Meanwhile, Mamora has promised to improve his staff welfare. He made the promise while delivering a speech at the NIWA 2018 end of year party held at the NIWA headquarters. Mamora said the NIWA amendment Act is still alive with the National Assembly and all efforts are being made to ensure the successful passage of the Amendment Act. He encouraged staff to always put in their best and promised to pay the thirteenth month salary in order to put smiles on the faces of the workers during the Christmas season.
