The abducted friend of late former Chief of Defence Staff, Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh (rtd) has regained freedom. He was allegedly released after his family paid a ransom running into millions of naira. Though, he was advised to stay off media, the joy of his freedom triggered him to give testimony in a religious gathering. The Nigerian Air Force said they have made substantial progress in their investigation and that details of the investigation would be made public in due course. The director of Public Relations and Information (DOPRI) said the service would not spare any effort in ensuring that it unravels the circumstances that led to the killing of former CDS and kidnap of other occupants of the vehicle. Recall that former CDS Alex Badeh was murdered on 18 December, 2018 along Keffi-Abuja road on his way from farm. The police had said in a statement last week that, “The former CDS suffered gunshot injury which resulted to his death, while his driver was injured and Badeh’s friend abducted.” Sources said the authorities are working on the theory that Badeh’s murder may have been an abduction gone wrong as the friend was released after a ransom was paid. It was further gathered that there had been two of such incidents along the Keffi-Abuja Expressway before Badeh’s murder in the last one month. “While investigations were on, the family of Badeh’s friend paid a ransom to ensure his release. However, we have continued with the investigation and we have made progress. We will inform members of the public after the Christmas break,” the source said. Badeh’s Tundra Toyota truck was riddled with bullets piercing the windscreen and killing him instantly. Out of the three occupants of the vehicle, however, Badeh was the only one that was killed thereby fueling speculations that he was assassinated.
