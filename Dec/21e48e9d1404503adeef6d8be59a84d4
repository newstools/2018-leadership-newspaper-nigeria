Some residents of Okada in Ovia North East local government have given reasons why they would not re-elect Barr. Omosede Igbinedion to the House of Representatives. Omosede who is the daughter of Chief Gabriel Igbinedion, the Esama of Benin Kingdom, hails from Okada. The Okada residents spoke when they paid an endorsement visit to candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Mr. Dennis Idahosa. Spokesman for the Okada residents, Mr. David Iyamu, said their support for the APC was to free Okada from the grips of the Igbinedions. Iyamu stated that it was pitiable that Okada community lacked basic amenities despite the children of Chief Igbinedion serving as Governor, council chairman and a member of the National Assembly. He said 2019 would be the end Chief Igbinedion reign in Okada According to him, “It is a thing of shame for us in Okada to say we do not have water, no road and electricity. “Okada community has produced a Governor, council chairman and a lawmaker all from one man and yet no meaningful development. “This election is about our children’s future. What will we tell them? We have to make Ovia great again.” Responding, Idahosa said he grew up as a poor child and knew what it means to empower people. Idahosa said Ovia students would get bursery and that he would work with relevant agencies to attract projects to all communities.
