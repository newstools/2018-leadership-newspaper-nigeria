The national reconciliation committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC)  led by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje was on Thursday, overwhelmed by the crowd of party members and dignitaries that turned up to welcome them at the campaign office of the APC governorship candidate, Hope Uzodimma, in Owerri. This was a sharp contrast to what happened at the Imo State Government House a day before, when they visited Governor Rochas Okorocha and only government appointees were present. A reliable source disclosed that it was clear to the committee members that the vast majority of party members and leaders were with the governorship candidate. Apart from the large crowd of APC members that turned out to welcome the committee, leaders of the party present included all the seven governorship aspirants except the deputy governor, Eze Madumere, who it was gathered, earlier asked to be excused. All national assembly candidates, serving House of Assembly members and candidates, Chief Marcelenus Nlemigbo, former PDP state chairman now chieftain of APC, Dr E. J. K Onyebuchi, chairman Imo APC Elders Council, and a host of other leaders were present. All the Ganduje committee members with the exception of the governor of Plateau State, were present at the meeting where the chairman briefed party faithful that the committee had met with Okorocha. Speaking on behalf of the leaders and members of Imo APC, Onyebuchi told the committee that it was the elders committee that drafted Uzodimma to the governorship race when it became clear to them that Okorocha was determined to foist his son in-law, Uche Nwosu, on the people of the state. “At this point, we were more interested in a popular figure who can stop Governor Okorocha, so we drafted Senator Uzodimma because we saw in him, the man with the popularity and capacity to stop Okorocha. “So Uzodimma is the candidate of Imo people. He did not come out on his own and I can assure you that Imo people will vote for him massively,” he declared.
