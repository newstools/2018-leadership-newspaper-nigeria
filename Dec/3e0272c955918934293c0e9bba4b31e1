The executive chairman of Etsako East local government area, Alhaji Aremiyau Momoh has called on former Ekiti State governor, Ayodele Fayose, to stay away from the internal affairs of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and face his problem with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the imminent defeat that awaits the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2019. The council boss, in a statement, was reacting to Fayose’s recent criticism of the APC national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, over attacks made by Oshiomhole against Imo State governor, Rochas Okorocha, during the official flag off of the APC governorship campaign in Imo State. He described Fayose as a bull in a China shop. In the statement, the Etsako East council boss reminds Fayose of the fact that “Oshiomhole and Rochas Okorocha are not only of the same party but friends who will soon put every conflict of interest behind and will work together for the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari in 2019.” Aremiyaun who wonders why the internal disagreement in the APC has become PDP’s problem, advised “that before Fayose talks about failure, he should take a look at the records and facts available on ground about his stewardship in Ekiti and that of Oshiomhole in Edo State. They both had two terms but his case was that of monumental failure.” “He (Fayose) should be reminded of how he crashed out in his first stint as Ekiti State governor. Firstly, he was impeached. He came back and he failed because of his antics and could not deliver Ekiti State to his party. That is the definition of failure”, said Aremiyau.
