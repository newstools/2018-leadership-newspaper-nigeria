The acting chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes commission, (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu has said that the commission does not  need upto 72 hours given by the court to produce a former minister of Petroleum Resources, Diezani Alison-Madueke, to face her corruption charges, stating that the only problem the commission has is that she is being held “in another man’s country”. Magu made this known in a statement signed by acting spokesperson of the EFCC, Tony Orilade. Expressing optimism with complying with the court order, Magu said: “We will comply with the court order. In fact, it is in our character to do so. If we won’t comply with the court order, that means we have reasons to appeal against the court decision. We need less than 72 hours to produce Diezani. But she is being prosecuted by other law enforcement agencies outside this country. This is our predicament.” Talking about the challenge in getting her, he said, “Another law enforcement agency is in the matter. You know she is in the United Kingdom. And we are making preparations to get her. We have already gone to the court, in fact it was our request for extradition that compelled the court to issue a warrant of arrest against her. I need just less than an hour. If she is here, I will get her immediately and take her before the court. Our problem is that she is in another man’s country”. Responding on the issue of not finding anything against the former minister, Magu said, “Nobody can say she has not committed anything. All the neighbouring countries in Europe and America and all the law enforcement agencies in the world have knowledge of Diezani’s money laundering activities”. Speaking on looted funds still hanging outside the country, Magu wondered why it was difficult for the countries concerned to repatriate the looted funds.
