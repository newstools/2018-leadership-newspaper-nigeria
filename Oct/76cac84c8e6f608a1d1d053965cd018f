Al Nassr forward, Ahmed Musa has vowed to inspire Nigeria to victory in their 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier Group E game against Libya this weekend. The deadly winger scored for the Super Eagles in the match day 2 game against the Pirates of Seychelles, which Nigeria won 3-0. “I’m ready to play on Saturday,” he informed Footballlive.ng. “I would like to repeat what happened in the game against Seychelles, and if I can score that would be good, but what matters is that we win the match at home to Libya. It’s a special game.” The former CSKA Moscow, Kano Pillars, VVV Venlo and Leicester City star then expanded on what it is that makes the game special. “In these types of games you have to give everything. They are heated encounters in which winning is complicated and there is no need to motivate anyone. “Libya has a very complete team, you must be careful of anyone. They are a difficult opponent.” Nigeria will host the first leg at the Godswill Akpabio Stadium in Uyo on Saturday 13th October with the return leg scheduled for the 18,000-capacity Stade Taïeb Mhiri in the city of Sfax, Tunisia on Tuesday 16th October. Libya has four points from their first two games in their bid to qualify for the 2019 finals in Cameroon, ahead of South Africa on goal difference with Nigeria one point behind. Seychelles are last in the group without any point.
