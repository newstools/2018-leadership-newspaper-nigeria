All Progressives Congress, (APC) has said the purported suspension of its National Vice Chairman, Northeast, Mr Mustapha Salihu is not true. Recall that the Secretary of the party in the North East Zone, Abubakar Ajiya, had on Saturday announced the alleged suspension of the Zonal Chairman, Mustapha Salihu. However, in its reaction, the leadership of the Party at the national level, in a press statement signed by National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Onilu stated that the powers to suspend a national officer, resides with the National Executive Committee (NEC). “We state categorically that the purported suspension is a nullity as the ‘North East Zonal Office’ does not have such powers to suspend a National Officer. According to the Party’s constitution, such powers reside with the National Executive Committee (NEC). “Whatever issues there might be, the party structure and constitution provides ample avenues for redress and dispute resolution. “If the “North East Zonal Office” is unable to achieve a resolution, the National Working Committee (NWC) can and will wade in the matter to achieve amicable settlement” the statement reads.
