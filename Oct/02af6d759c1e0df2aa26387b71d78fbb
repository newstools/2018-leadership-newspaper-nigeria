An All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirant in Kwara State, Prof Shuaib AbdulRaheem, yesterday declared that he remains a committed stalwart of the party, despite his discontentment over the party’s controversial primary elections in the state. AbdulRaheem while addressing his supporters at the Ilorin International Airport on his arrival from Abuja, insisted that he won the governorship primaries of the party in the state. He claimed to have won in nine out of the 16 local government areas in the state and scored overall majority votes in the primaries. On Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq’s candidacy, AbdulRaheem said , “When we met with President Muhammadu Buhari, we were not told to support any particular candidate. We were appealed to, to support the party and not any individual. ” I’m very sure that justice and fairness would be done at end of the amendment process. I won convincingly in nine out of the 16 local government areas in the state and it is a well known fact to everyone. But whosoever emerge would be supported in the interest of the party.” He added that: “I will remain in APC no matter whom the party flag is given to. APC remains the only and best alternative for the people of this nation . I will not leave APC no matter the circumstance(s). “What we are facing now is just a mere misunderstanding and as soon as it is put to rest, we shall all come together in unison in order to ensure the victory of the party in the forthcoming general elections .” He thanked his supporters for standing by him, stressing that, “everything will soon be over.”
