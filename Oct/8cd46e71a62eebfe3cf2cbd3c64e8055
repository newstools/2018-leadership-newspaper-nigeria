The International Monetary Fund (IMF) yesterday predicted that inflation rate in Nigeria would rise to 13.5 per cent in 2019. Deputy director at IMF’s research department, Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti, disclosed this yesterday while addressing journalists at the ongoing annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Group in Bali, Indonesia. The IMF had in its World Economic Outlook report released earlier in July projected that Nigeria’s economy would grow by 2.1 percent in 2018 and 2.3 percent in 2019. But in the October edition of the report, IMF cut the growth projections. Ferretti said, “Nigeria’s growth, 1.9 percent this year; 2.3 next year. South Africa, only 0.8 percent this year. Angola, contracting by 0.1 percent this year. So the aggregate — over three percent this year, close to four percent next year — is despite the largest economies in the continent doing poorly. “The continent could do much better once these economies are on a more solid footing, particularly South Africa and Nigeria because they are really large and affect a number of countries in their neighbourhood. “In Nigeria and Angola, tighter monetary policy and moderation in food price increases contributed to tapering inflation. In Nigeria, inflation is projected to fall to 12.4 percent in 2018, from 16.5 percent in 2017, and to rise to 13.5 percent in 2019,” the report read.
