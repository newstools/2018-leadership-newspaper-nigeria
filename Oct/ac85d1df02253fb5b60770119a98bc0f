Fellow Nigerians, Today is a day of celebration and solemn reflection. It is the anniversary of the day Nigerians realised one of the most cherished of human desires â€“ the desire for freedom. We, therefore, give thanks to and remember our founding fathers who laboured so hard and sacrificed so much to build and bequeath to us this wonderful nation. It is our duty to consolidate this great legacy. Fellow Nigerians, Fellow Nigerians, Fellow Nigerians, Thank you. I wish you a memorable independence celebration.
