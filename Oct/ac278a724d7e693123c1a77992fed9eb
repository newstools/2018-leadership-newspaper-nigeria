Former minister of Defence, Lieutenant General Theophilus Danjuma (rtd), yesterday disassociated himself from a news report suggesting that he accused President Muhammadu Buhari of planning to accommodate all West African Fulanis in the entire Southern and Middle Belt regions of Nigeria. Danjuma was in the statement which went viral in the social media yesterday alleged to have said that the people of Middle Belt, South West, South South and South East should forget about 2019 elections and first fight back the Fulani murderous invaders and reclaim their lands, which are now under herdsmen. But in a statement issued on his behalf by former minister of Water Resources, Chief Obadiah Ando, Danjuma said the divisive statement did not emanate from him or from anybody authorised by him. Ando regretted that such derogatory statement entitled “Choose your own Fulani with care” was mischievously and falsely attributed to him. He urged Nigerians to dissociate TY Danjuma from the contents of the post and ignore the statement. The statement reads in part: “My attention has been drawn to posts making social media rounds, relaying statement allegedly made by Lt. Gen T.Y Danjuma, among which is one titled “Choose your own Fulani with care”, purportedly directed at people of South-West, South-Central, South-South and South-East. “It is important to set records straight by making it clear to all citizens that these statements did not emanate from Lt. Gen. Danjuma or from persons authorized by him, but have been mischievously and falsely attributed to him. “Lt. Gen Danjuma dissociates himself from the contents of these posts and urges Nigerians to ignore them.”
