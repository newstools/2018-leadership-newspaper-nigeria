The Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, Yekini Nabena, has said contrary to insinuations in some quarters, the National Chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole, enjoys the support of the party’s leadership. Nabena also said statements credited to him alleging that he made uncomplimentary remarks about the chairman’s handling of party affairs were false. In a statement he signed in Abuja, on Wednesday, Nabena said “My attention has been drawn to a comment credited to me in one of the national newspapers on Comrade Adams Oshiomhole’s national leadership of our great party, the APC and the party’s current state-of-affairs. “The statement ascribed to me in the news publication is completely false.
