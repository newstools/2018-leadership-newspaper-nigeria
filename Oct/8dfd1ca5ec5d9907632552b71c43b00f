…petition Oshiomhole, Buhari, IGP, others Scores of protesters of the governing All Progressives Congress, (APC) from Niger, Nasarawa, Enugu and Kano, on Monday besieged the National Secretariat of the party in Abuja to protest against emergence of the various candidates they felt emerged through questionable means. The protesters who came at various times between 10am and 7pm, came in various groups chanting “Oshiomohle must go”, “APC is a fraud” among others, completely shut down the secretariat. One of the group as led by Muhammad Awwal Kofa alleged that the exercise that produced Senator representing Kano South Senatorial district, Kabiru Gaya was marred by a lot of irregularities, ranging from election malpractices, rigging, compilation and announcement of fake election by Kano APC. Gaya, who will end his third term in June 2019 as a Senator, has again been declared winner of the primary election conducted across sixteen local governments, 171 wards in Kano South Senatorial district. After the protest, a petition, submitted to the National Chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole which was obtained by journalists in Abuja demanded that the alternative election be cancelled and declare Sulaiman Abdulrahaman Kawu, the winner having complied with the guidelines of the party during first exercise. The petition partly read, “The primaries election in Kano State were not conducted by the electoral panel sent by the National headquarters and the result was not announced by appropriate official legally. “Therefore, we unambiguously demand that alternatively the election rigged, giving false results. This election process was entirely contravention of our party’s election guideline and constitution as there was no true and sincere internal democracy.”
