The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) gubernatorial candidate in Bauchi State, Senator Bala Mohammed, has reached out to aggrieved governorship aspirants of the All Progressives Congress (APC) who were shortchanged at the recent primary elections to join his campaign structure with a view to defeating the incumbent governor Mohammed Abubakar in 2019. The former minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) made the call yesterday while inaugurating his campaign harmonisation committee. He explained that the committee was set up and charged with the responsibility of consoling those who lost primary elections in the party as well as wooing aggrieved members of other parties. He noted that shortly after he emerged victorious in the recent PDP governorship primary election, he visited his contenders Senators Abdul Ningi and Adamu Gumba and solicited their support ahead of the 2019 general election. He promised that if elected, he would improve the welfare of workers and pensioners in the state whom he alleged were being maltreated by the present state government. In his response the chairman of the committee and former Senator representing Bauchi Central Bala Adamu Kariya applauded the governorship candidate for inaugurating the committee assuring that he would work towards uniting PDP members in the state so that the party could triumph in the next election.
