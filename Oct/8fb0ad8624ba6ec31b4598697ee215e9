Sequel to his disqualification from the Oyo state governorship contest by the National Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for skipping the mandatory NYSC scheme, Minister of Communications, Barr. Adebayo Shittu, has blamed Governor Abiola Ajimobi for his ordeals in order to edge him out of the race to Agodi Government House. This is even as the Minister revealed that he has “on good authority” that Governor Ajimobi also skipped the national youth service scheme. LEADERSHIP reports that APC NWC had on Friday disqualified Shittu and other aspirants from the governorship race after the minister admitted that he deliberately skipped national service because he felt his membership of the Oyo House of Assembly at the time of his graduation was same as national youth service scheme. Reacting to the NYSC certificate saga on Channels TV’s “Sunday Politics” yesterday and monitored by our reporter, Shittu revealed that Ajimobi, who recently indicated that he would be running for the Senate after his tenure as governor, does not possess NYSC certificate. He noted that the NYSC certificate issue over which he was disqualified was allegedly ochestrated by Governor Ajimobi to get him out of the race because the governor knows that he will jail him if he becomes the next governor of Oyo State.
