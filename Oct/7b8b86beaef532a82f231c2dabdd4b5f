Kogi State Police Command has confirmed that it sent a detachment of officers to the Senator Dino Melaye’s house at Aiyetoro-Gbede, in Kogi State, on October 11, to arrest him. In a statement in Lokoja, the command said it took the action in connection with the July 19 shooting of one of its operatives, Sgt Danjuma Salihu, by thugs suspected to be loyal to the senator. The statement signed by the command’s spokesman, DSP William Aya, said that the clarification followed the allegation of Melaye on his twitter page of October 12, that the ADC to Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi led some officers to his house to assassinate him. “The ADC has nothing to do with this case. The command wishes to state unequivocally that the statement is not only a figment of the imagination of Senator Melaye, who has mastered the art of political gimmickry, but totally false, malicious and highly mischievous. “The commissioner of Police sent officers to his country home to arrest him, unfortunately we did not meet him at home,” the statement said. It accused Melaye, who is representing Kogi West senatorial district of mobilising thugs to attack its personnel on routine duty along Mopa–Aiyetoro-Gbede on July 19, without any provocation. “The thugs shot and injured Force No. 432913, Sgt Danjuma Saliu, who is currently receiving treatment at Veda Crest Hospital, Abuja,” the statement said. Aya said Melaye was officially invited through letter No AR:3000/KGS/X/VOL.43/670, dated 23/7/2018, to come and answer the charges levelled against him, but he refused to show up or give reason for not honouring the invitation. “The Senator is wanted by the Kogi State Police Command for criminal conspiracy, attempted culpable homicide and unlawful possession of firearms,” the statement explained.
