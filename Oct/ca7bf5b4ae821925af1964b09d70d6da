President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday, in Abuja, said his administration remains focused and energised in ensuring accountability in the country, noting that enforcing the Treasury Single Account (TSA) was not optional for growth. Receiving executives of the Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN) led by Shehu Usman Ladan at the Presidential Villa, President Buhari, in a statement by his special adviser media, Femi Adesina, said insistence on the financial structure required much sacrifice and focus on the part of the government. “One of the cardinal objectives of this administration is that people and all government institutions must give account of what comes in and goes out. “We did not introduce TSA, but we enforced it. TSA makes a lot of sense that you must have to give account of whatever comes in and goes out in government finance, that’s accountability,’’ the President said. President Buhari urged accountants to remain focused and support the government in the ongoing fight against corruption, warning that they might not be liked by many people because of their professional ethics, but the sacrifice was necessary for the country to grow. In his remarks, the president of ANAN, Ladan, commended President Buhari for the laudable achievements in ensuring an inclusive and strong economy by plugging leakages, and making youth empowerment and infrastructure top priority. He noted that the President’s assent to the Not-Too-Young-To- Run bill further encourage youth participation in governance even as he commended the fight against terrorism and extoled the administration’s effort in getting the economy out of recession and repositioning it for diversity through agriculture. In view of all these, ANAN announced its support for Buhari’s reelection in 2019, and canvassed for more recognition and appreciation of members of the association in the public service The group also suggested that ANAN be included in the federal scheme of service where a number of professional bodies are listed for direct appointment on Grade Level 10.
