The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said it has reviewed the world press conference of Lagos State Governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, and surmised that the governor validated its position that the All Progressives Congress (APC) consists of fraudsters and election riggers. PDP recalled that Governor Ambode had in the press conference stated that his opponent in the race, Babajide Sanwoolu, was arrested for spending fake dollars in the United States. Governor Ambode, according to PDP, further stated that Sanwoolu was detained in the USA on account of the alleged crime. A statement by the national spokesman of PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the governor further alleged that his party (APC) was disenfranchising its members by insisting that registered members of the party, who were yet to be issued with membership cards, will not be allowed to participate in the gubernatorial primary election. Ologbondiyan noted that by those comments, “the whole world can see that the APC is nothing but a den of  fraudsters and corrupt persons who not only cheated their way to power  through lies and propaganda in 2015 but have also continued to bleed and  defraud our nation with humongous sleazes and massive corruption in very  high places. “That is why the APC will have no scruples to project persons of  questionable character and those with allegations of corruption hanging  on the necks as their national chairman and governorship aspirants. “We challenge President Muhammadu Buhari to show his claimed integrity by  ordering an open investigation into this huge allegation against his  party’s governorship aspirant. ‘Finally, the PDP calls on  Lagosians and indeed all Nigerians to note  this ugly trend in the APC and ensure that they throw this undesirable  party to the dustbin of history, come 2019,” the statement said.
