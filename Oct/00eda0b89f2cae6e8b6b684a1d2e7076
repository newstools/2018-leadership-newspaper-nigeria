The runner up at the yesterday’s Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) gubernatorial primary in Gombe state, Dr. Jamil Isyaku Gwamna, has officially defected to the All Progressive Congress (APC). Gwamna and 7 others lost the Gombe PDP governorship primary election to Sen. Bayero Nafada, the incumbent Senator representing Gombe North. After the primary, Gwamna expressed dissatisfaction with the “injustice and abnormalities that marred the exercise.” While addressing Journalists in Gombe on Tuesday to announce his defection, Gwamna said leaving the PDP was not an easy decision to make considering being in the party since 2007 and the huge investment and sacrifice he has made in building the party in the state. He said the decision was never about him as a person but it was about the interest of the  people who associate with him during his aspiration and more importantly the collective interest and future of Gombe people. “For me politics has always been an opportunity to serve and make contribution towards the development of my people and the nation.” He said it was based on this conviction that he was compelled to make a choice between loyalty to a political party and loyalty to the state. “I am not seeking for the seat of the governor for personal interest but for the people, having considered the injustice in the PDP we have to seek for an alternative to resist and stop the evil agenda of one man to put our people in perpetual enslavement.” “Having consulted with the supporters we have decided to leave the PDP, we are joining forces with eminent Gombe sons and daughters to work tirelessly to ensure the emergence of President Muhammadu Buhari and Inuwa Yahaya in the APC”
