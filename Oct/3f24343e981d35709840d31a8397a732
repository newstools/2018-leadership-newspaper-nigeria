The federal government will this week announce the figure of the new minimum wage for workers in the country. President of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Ayuba Wabba, who disclosed this yesterday, said this followed the completion of negotiations by the tripartite committee negotiating new wages for workers. Speaking with journalists in Abuja, he noted that the committee has completed its assignment and is ready for onward submission of its report to President Muhammadu Buhari. According to him, the committee used the two days following the suspension of the strike action by organised labour to reconvene and deliberate on a new minimum wage figure that is acceptable to all employers of labour in the country. Wabba said, “I want to assure workers that all has been concluded and will be passed for signing within the week. I also want to appreciate the Organised Private Sector, Manufacturers Association of Nigeria and Nigeria Employers Consultative Association (NECA) for their resolve to pay the new minimum wage when it is signed into law”. The NLC president however refused to disclose the figure arrived at by the tripartite committee on the new national minimum wage. Wabba said the presidency would make it public after deliberation at the National Economic Council (NEC) meeting. LEADERSHIP recallS that organised labour had two years ago demanded for an increase of the minimum wage from its current N18,000 to N56,000. During the submission of memorandum to the tripartite committee negotiating the new minimum wage, the workers later increased the figure to N65,000. Following a series of setbacks, President Buhari in November 2017 inaugurated a tripartite committee to commence negotiations for a national minimum wage.
