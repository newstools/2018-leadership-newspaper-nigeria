A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Taraba State, Alhaji Abubakar Jauro Jalingo said the party has made a costly mistake in handing over its ticket to the former acting governor, Danladi Sani. Jaura told journalists that the development will cost the party the unique opportunity to wrest power from the ruling People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in 2019. Speaking to journalists in Abuja, yesterday, Jauro insisted that Sani was not the ideal candidate to carry the party’s ticket. He wondered why Sani who joined APC two months ago and is currently a guest of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for allegedly diverting billions of naira from Taraba State treasury when he was acting governor, was allowed to get the party’s ticket. “Don’t forget that Sani was indicted by the Supreme Court which sacked him as senator representing Taraba North Senatorial District in the National Assembly. “Not only that, Sani was also impeached by the Taraba State House of Assembly when he was deputy governor under late Danbaba Suntai. “How can somebody who has these records win primary under President Buhari’s watch” he queried. Meanwhile, eight governorship aspirants of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Taraba called for cancellation of the party’s governorship primary election in the state due to alleged irregularities. Speaking on behalf of the aggrieved aspirants, David Kente, described the exercise as “a sham’’ even as he called for an order declaring it inconclusive and a fresh one conducted. “There was massive violence in Jalingo, Wukari, Karim Lamido and Zing local government areas in spite of the agreement we all signed to ensure a violent-free process. Kente urged President Muhammadu Buhari, national and state leadership of the party “to declare the purported primary election conducted inconclusive and a fresh primary conducted in the state with neutral people presiding over the process”
