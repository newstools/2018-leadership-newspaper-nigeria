Youths and stakeholders under the auspices of the Bindow Awareness for Change (BAC) has called on the wife of the president, Hajiya Aisha Buhari to embrace and respect all of the aspirants as she is an umbrella of hope for many in the state and Nigeria as a whole. As the mother of the nation, the group further urged her to stop the unfair interference in Adamawa politics especially her intrusions on the ongoing APC guber primaries. The call was made in a press statement signed by the National Coordinators of BAC and the Youth League of the party, Honourable Julius Benson and the National Publicity Secretary, Haruna Zakari, yesterday. According to the statement, everything Aisha Buhari has done or said about the Adamawa guber primaries has only made her look desperate to snatch power for her brother and belittle her as the mother of the nation and wife of the president. “Along with her brother, she reached out to the top leaders of the party for a shift of the election date and it was done. They asked for a change in the venue and time and it was done. They asked for a change in the process of the election from the indirect to the direct primaries and it was done and now that the people of Adamawa have spoken, she wants to cry wolve and sabotage a fine electioneering process “, the statement added. “These actions have dainted the good name, integrity and reputation of her husband and it’s unfortunate that she is so power desperate that she doesn’t even realise it. The President and his wife got to where they are today because of the voice of the people, Hajiya Buhari should respect the fact that, the people have spoken in Adamawa”. “We wish to call on her as one of our own in Adamawa to stop this unfair interference and intrusion in our politics and the APC guber primaries. It is God who giveth and taketh power, Hajiya Buhari of all people should know that. No amount of force or brute can make a man win election if God doesn’t destined he will win”.
