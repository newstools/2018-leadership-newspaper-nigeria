No fewer than 7,000 delegates are expected at the special national convention of the APC where the party’s presidential candidate, President Muhammadu Buhari, is expected to be ratified as the party’s flag bearer. This is as clarification has emerged about those who will be among the delegates, especially in states where there are parallel executives. However, only those recognised by the National Working Committee (NWC) will gain admittance at the venue. Briefing journalists at the APC national secretariat on behalf of the   chairman, Convention Planning Committee and Oyo State governor,  Senator Abiola Ajimobi,  the vice chairman of the committee and Borno State governor, Dr Kashim Shettima, said the party leadership was working towards resolving outstanding knotty issues. He said: “As we prepare for the special convention tomorrow to confirm the nomination of our candidate, President Muhammadu Buhari, let me assure you that the nomination and ratification of his candidacy is a commitment to steady, progressive and positive change. “In spite some of the challenges encountered during the primaries in our various states, the NWC of the party is working assiduously to resolve all issues. It is a family quarrel and we are going to sort things out amicably. “We are expecting to host about 7,000 delegates from across the length and breadth of our great country and all necessary arrangements are in place for a smooth convention.”
