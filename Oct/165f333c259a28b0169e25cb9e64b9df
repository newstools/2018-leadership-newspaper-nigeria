The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Gombe state chapter finally held its governorship primary which was aborted midway on Sunday night when some of the party stakeholders stormed the Gombe state government house banquet hall venue of the exercise and tore open the ballot boxes in protest over alleged manipulations. The election which took place at the same venue on Monday night to the early hours of Tuesday saw Senator Usman Bayero Nafada emerging winner with 1104 defeating 12 other candidates. While Jamilu Isyaku Gwamna, the runner up got distant votes of 147, while Ahmed Walama and Hassan Mohammadu got 16 votes each. Others are Bala Bello Tinka 11, Major Gen. Sylvester Audu 7 votes, Alhassan Mohammad Fawu and Ahmed Mohammed Goje got 2 votes each while Haruna Garba got 3 votes with Abdulkadir Hamasalleh and Umaru Bello recording no vote. In reaction, the runner up, Jamil Isyaku Gwamna , faulted the exercise, saying it was a mere charade planned to favour the winner. Jamil said what was experience in Gombe “is an act of robbery and a harbinger of intimidation which could culminate into having crisis within the party.” In a statement signed and issued by his media coordinator, Sani Ibrahim Shawai, shortly after the exercise, he lamented that it was a clear victory for him until the antics of Senator Bayero Nafada, who openly disrupted the process on Sunday night to allow him and his cohorts arranged the charade that took place on Monday. “The coast was clear for Dr. Jamil Isyaku Gwamna, until the thugs of the senator succeeded in disrupting the business of the day to have a secret meeting of intimidation and alleged cases of vote and conscience buying which resulted to the purportedly fake and cooked up victory of senator Bayero Nafada.” He said. “We therefore totally reject the outcome of the results and as such call on all true democrats in our party to come to our rescue in Gombe State because our democracy is now under siege.” He added.
