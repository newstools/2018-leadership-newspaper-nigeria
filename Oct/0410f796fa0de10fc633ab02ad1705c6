The Senate yesterday passed a total budget allocation of N234 billion for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the 2018 fiscal year for the conduct of the 2019 general election. Out of the approved budget, the upper chamber okayed the sum of N189 billion to be vired from both recurrent and capital components of the Special Intervention Programme of N500 billion captured in the Service Wide Vote of the 2018 Appropriation Act. It, however, approved the balance of N143 billion for INEC from virement in the 2018 budget without specifying the source of the virement, even as it said N45 billion should be provided for the commission under statutory transfer. This followed the presentation of the report on INEC 2019 election budget by the Senate Committee on Appropriation chaired by Senator Danjuma Goje. While presenting the report, Goje explained that the committee considered President Muhammadu Buhari â€™s request for N 242 billion for INEC and security agencies to conduct the election. Also, security agencies yesterday appeared before the Senate committee on appropriation to defend their budgets. But the Senate committee chairman, Goje directed the Inspector General of police, National Security Adviser (NSA), Director of DSS, Comptroller General of Nigeria Immigration Service, and Commandant of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defense Corps to submit their memorandum to various committees overseeing their agencies for onward consideration. While issuing the directive, Senator Goje said the appropriation committee would recieve the defense report of the security agencies on Tuesday October 16, 2018.
