The outgoing Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose has begged governor elect, Dr. Kayode Fayemi to assist him in paying four months salary arrears being owed workers in the state after assuming office as governor. Fayose said he would have paid up owed salaries but the monies he could have used to pay had been allegedly withheld by the federal government. The governor who claimed that monies was being kept for Fayemi’s resumption said: “They paid other states Paris Refund, they didn’t pay Ekiti; Fayemi should help me pay the money. “They didn’t pay N2.2bn Budget Support Fund; My promise is fulfilled but the money is in the hands of government, they should help me to pay.” He spoke yesterday during the inauguration of a new school he built in his Afao-Ekiti home country as part of his legacy projects. The governor, it would be recalled had repeatedly promised not to leave office a debtor of salaries. Fayose who noted that he did not borrow money from anywhere to fund any of the projects said, “With all these legacy projects, I didn’t borrow any dime. I’m not owing any debt, if they say I’m owing they should show evidence of transaction”. “Besides, no governor can borrow without the knowledge of the Ministry of Finance and the Debt Management Office.” He, however, urged the incoming administration not to neglect the school or abandon any legacy project. The school, named Gifted Academy International according to him would receive students from Ekiti and outside on 50:50 ratio. “The school is equipped with modern equipment, laboratories, furniture and Closed-Circuit Television,(CCTV)for surveillance,” he said. He urged the people of the town to preserve the heritage and support government in sustaining it.
