A Special Assistant to Governor Godwin Obaseki in Ohordua, Esan South East local government, Mr. Imhandegbelo Louis, has resigned his appointment and defected to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Louis said he left the ruling APC because of highhandedness of the party leader in the locality. He joined the PDP at a rally held at Ohordua village. Louis said he has engaged in several humanitarian services to empower the people ahead of next yearâ€™s general elections. The former Obaseki aide said he would mobilize his supporters for the PDP. Receiving the APC defectors, leader of the PDP in the locality, Mr. Lawrence Odiase, said they would accord them all rights and privileges of former members of the party. Odiase stated that members of the ruling party are joining the PDP in droves despite the party being in opposition.
