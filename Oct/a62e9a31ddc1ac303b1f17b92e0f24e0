Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Matthew Hassan Kukah said yesterday that he never endorsed any politician ahead of 2019 general elections as being speculated in some quarters. In a statement yesterday, Kukah who affirmed that reconciling two or more conflicting persons for a continued harmonious relationship is part of their pastoral callings, said what has transpired in the case of former President Olusegun Obasanjo and Alhaji Atiku Abubakar is no different from what they have been doing before then. While stressing that most people of goodwill who also believes in peace truly appreciate their effort in reconciling the duo, Bishop Kukah wondered why some deliberately attributed politics to it without looking at the need to make peace as a supreme task. “I was not in Abeokuta to endorse Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, the candidate of the Peoples’ Democratic Party. I perfectly understand the feelings of many of my friends and members of the opposition who believe that I travelled with Alhaji Abubakar and his team to attend his endorsement by President Obasanjo, but I reiterate that this was not the case”. Giving his account of what transpired, Bishop Kukah said, “I have deliberately made this explanatory note long because I think it is necessary that people make up their minds based on the facts, given my central role in the event. “ I note that Sheikh Gumi has already told his own side of the story. I feel obliged to state my own side so that Nigerians can have a clearer picture of my own involvement.  “Sadly, I personally did not read President Obasanjo’s statement until two days later on the Internet since I was not physically in the hall.” Kukah further noted that Obasanjo called to accept the suggestion of reconciling with Atiku as a Christian and requested that they come together to his house on Wednesday that week.
