Specifically, Yari said: “There is going to be a bloodshed tomorrow if the election is held in that way and and I’m the one to provide security for the peaceful conduct of the exercise.” The grudge of the Governor was the decision of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party to adhere to court order and avoid contempt of court. Marafa in a statement urged President Buhari and the IG to stop Yari from killing innocent people over party primaries. ” It is unfortunate that a Governor that has turned a blind eye to the death of thousands will threaten to cause bloodbath in his state because of party issues. What a shame? ” For me, my ambition is premised on the need to salvage the state from total collapse! It is not a do-or-die affair. The lives of our people are more important. No stone would be left unturned in protecting the lives and property of our people” he said. He said audio clips of the Governor’s threats would be made available to the President, the IGP, all relevant security agencies and the international community.
