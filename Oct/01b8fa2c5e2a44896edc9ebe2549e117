The former President, Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade AbdulWaheed Omar has called on the federal government to reason with organised labour in addressing the lingering issue of minimum wage once and for all, to avoid shutting down the country on November 6 as promised by Labour Unions due to negotiation break down. Comrade Omar made the call while interacting with newsmen in Abuja over the weekend. He lamented the fact that government was not realistic with issue of minimum wage considering the cost of living in the country. Speaking further, Comrade Omar said the situation where by government will continue to spend heavily on political office holders (both executive and legislative arms of government) with perennial huge spending in conducting elections after each four- year circle, while neglecting the welfare of Nigerian workers is unacceptable. Comrade Omar asserts that government is not handling the minimum wage matter the way it should. He stated that the minimum wage issue had become a law from the time it was passed by the National Assembly and assented to by the then President Goodluck Jonathan. The guidelines are clearly spelt out. The law provides that a review be made every five years and the composition of the review committee is also defined. He recalled how he stood his ground to fight for the workers and the masses on the issue of petroleum pump price during his tenure as the NLC President. He, however, appealed to the Ayuba Wabba- led leadership of the NLC to tread with caution and insist on amicable resolution of the problem to avoid crippling the economy and inflicting untold hardship to the masses.
