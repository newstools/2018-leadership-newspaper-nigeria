Chairman of the Senate Committee on Petroleum (Downstream), Senator Kabiru Garba Marafa has dissociated and distanced himself from meeting said to have been convened by the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole with Zamfara governorship aspirants on Thursday. According to a statement signed by him in Abuja on Friday, Marafa said this while reacting to an online media story headlined “Oshiomhole meets Zamfara Guber aspirants, as party considers Lawal”, reported that the APC national chairman met with the nine governorship aspirants in Abuja on Thursday. Marafa,who is one of the aspirants disclosed that he was not aware of the meeting. ” My attention has been drawn to an online publication headlined: “Oshiomhole meets Zamfara Guber aspirants, as party considers Lawal. ” I want to state emphatically that nobody invited me to any meeting after the failed attempt to conduct primaries/consensus as at 12am Sunday 7th Oct 2018. ” I want to restate further ( for emphasis) that there was neither election nor consensus reached among APC aspirants in Zamfara state,” he said. Marafa who represents the Zamfara Central Senatorial District at the Senate, said he would not be party of any move to trade with the APC Governorship ticket of Zamfara, insisting that due process and rule of law must be religiously adhered to. ” I will not be a party to any attempt by anybody to sell the tickets of APC to any desperate politician(s) by anybody. “I will resist any attempt by anybody to do so. May Allah (SWT) guide us to the straight path and give us the ability to act justly and fairly,” he said.
