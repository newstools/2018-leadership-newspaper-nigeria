The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has yesterday written off the Bayelsa State owned Samson Siasia Stadium in Yenagoa, declaring it unfit for international football matches. CAF medical committee member, Dr Peter Singabele said the continental body came to the decision after the stadium failed rain flood control test, on Tuesday. Speaking during the Restoration Cup Draws and Kits Presentation Ceremony in Yenagoa, Singabele said if nothing is done fast, the situation may affect the chances of the state owned teams from using the newly renovated stadium. Reacting to the decision of CAF, the governor of the State, Hon. Seriake Dickson, said last year the state government made full payment for the construction of a standard drainage system at the stadium to Monimichele Construction Company. According to him, the government also paid upfront for the refurbishment of the turf at the stadium but wondered why the stadium cannot be put to use for international football matches. “Bayelsans are my witnesses. I have no hand in the delay of the construction of the Stadium; rather it is the contractor that is indebted to Bayelsa state. I hereby call on the contractor to complete the project with immediate effect.”
