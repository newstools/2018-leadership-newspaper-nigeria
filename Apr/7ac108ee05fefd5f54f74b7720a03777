A former commissioner for local government and a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Mr Mikaiah Tokwak, has alleged that governor Nasir el-Rufai told him he will not need votes from Southern Kaduna to win his reelection bid in 2019. Tokwak, a former appointee of Governor el-Rufai, said any Southern Kaduna person that votes the governor from the party level and beyond, come 2019 at the general elections, will be “cursed.” The former commissioner spoke to a group of Southern Kaduna youth and women in Jaba local government area of the State, at a symposium tagged Ham project with a theme, “Mobilising Women and Youths in Politics Now”. According to him, “go and tell the present governor that I, Mikaiah Tokwak said any Southern Kaduna person that votes for him, either during primary elections or general elections, is a curse to his people.” Tokwak, was quoted saying,  “el-Rufai is a governor today because of Southern Kaduna. His people did not vote him during the primary elections.” He disclosed that, “Southern Kaduna gave him 75 per cent of their vote. I am not lying, see my brother Husseini Dembo. “When things started going astray, Senator Hunkuyi called us for a meeting with him, we got talking and what the man said was that we are 30 per cent in Kaduna State but we dominated the civil service 100 per cent, adding that the Northern part has never asked.” “el-Rufai further said that he does not need one vote from Southern Kaduna,  Zones I and II will vote for him. “If the governor said he does not need one vote from you, why should you vote for him? He asked.
