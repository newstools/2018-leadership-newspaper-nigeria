Ahead of the 2019 general elections, Christian Leaders under the auspices of United Christian Leaders Eagle Eyes Forum (UCLEEF) have called on Nigerians irrespective of religious, ethnic and political inclinations to “awake and save our dear nation” as it is the citizenry that have the power, right and choice to make the country great again. Using the recent invasion of the Senate chambers by suspected thugs, the leaders stressed that the panacea to the social decadence in the country was the need for a leader with vision and a mindset to make the nation great stressing that “Nigeria needs a leader not a ruler” This was the thrust of their message read and signed by the forum’s chairman, Pastor Aminchi Habu at a press conference with journalists in Abuja, Thursday, even as he assured that prayers and fasting had commenced by both Christian and Muslim faithfuls so that a true leader will emerge out of the many aspirants. Pastor Habu said: ” I indulge each and every citizen of this country to awake and save our dear nation. We all have the power, the right and the choice to make the right and wise decision so that Nigeria will be great again. “What Nigeria needs is a leader with vision and a mindset to make this nation great. Nigeria needs a leader not a ruler. Someone who is bold enough to see failure and turn it to success not someone who will see failure and blame others for it. “That is why we as a Christian forum with some of our Muslim brothers with like mindset have entered into prayers and fasting that before we reach the middle of the year, that is June, a true leader will emerge out of the many aspirants.
