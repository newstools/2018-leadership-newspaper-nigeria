Gunmen suspected to be members of a cult group on Wednesday night, attacked a Police Station, injuring two policemen at Ubeta Community in Ahoada-West local government area of Rivers State. Ubeta is the headquarters of Ubie Clan and plays host to facilities belonging to the Nigeria Liquified Natural Gas (NLNG), Total Exploration and Production Limited (TEPNG) and the Nigerian Agip Oil Company (NAOC) LEADERSHIP Friday gathered that the hoodlums, inflicted several machete cuts on the two policemen, who were on night duty, before escaping with their rifles. A source in the community, who pleaded for anonymity for the safety of his life, said the gunmen operated unchallenged as they took on the police team unawares, causing severe damage, before escaping towards the communities bordering Igbuduya Clan, also in Ahoada-West local government area of the state. The attack on Ubeta Police Station came barely two weeks after hoodlumsÂ  attacked the Community Secondary School at Okogbe where they abducted three female students and gang-raped them. Speaking to LEADERSHIP Friday, an indigene of Ubeta Community, Mr Nna Frank-Jack, described the development as very sad which may lead to another mass exodus of residents over fear of a repeat of the painful ordeals they experienced in 2016 in the hands of hoodlums. When contacted, Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Omoni Nnamdi, said he could not confirm the incident, since he is yet to be briefed on the attack by the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) in-charge of that area. Omoni promised to get back to the reporter as soon as possible but as at the time of filing this report, nothing was heard from him.
